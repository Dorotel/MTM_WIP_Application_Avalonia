# Repository Analysis: MTM WIP Application Avalonia

## Overview

The MTM WIP Application Avalonia is a comprehensive Work-In-Process (WIP) inventory management system developed for Manitowoc Tool and Manufacturing (MTM). This .NET 8 application leverages the Avalonia UI framework to provide a modern, cross-platform desktop interface for managing manufacturing inventory operations including part tracking, location management, and transaction processing.

The system serves as a critical tool for manufacturing operations, enabling real-time inventory tracking with operation-specific workflow management. It bridges traditional manufacturing processes with modern software architecture through its use of stored procedures, MVVM patterns, and comprehensive dependency injection.

## Architecture

### Core Framework
- **Platform**: .NET 8 with Avalonia UI Framework
- **Architecture Pattern**: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) with dependency injection
- **Data Access**: Stored procedure-based database operations via `Helper_Database_StoredProcedure`
- **Service Layer**: Organized by functional categories (ErrorHandling, Configuration, Navigation, Database)
- **UI Pattern**: Standard .NET data binding with INotifyPropertyChanged (post-ReactiveUI removal)

## Key Components

### **Inventory Management System**
- **Primary Interface**: `InventoryTabViewModel` - Main inventory entry and management
- **Advanced Operations**: `AdvancedInventoryViewModel` - Bulk operations, Excel integration, multi-location management
- **Transfer Operations**: `TransferItemViewModel` - Inter-location inventory transfers
- **Removal Operations**: `RemoveItemViewModel` & `AdvancedRemoveViewModel` - Inventory withdrawal management

### **Service Infrastructure**
- **Database Service**: Centralized stored procedure execution with `Helper_Database_StoredProcedure.ExecuteDataTableWithStatus()`
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management with user-friendly messaging
- **Configuration Service**: Application settings and state management
- **Navigation Service**: Application flow control and view management

### **Data Models**
- **InventoryItem**: Core inventory entity with PartID, Operation (string numbers), Location, Quantity
- **InventoryTransaction**: Transaction tracking with types: IN, OUT, TRANSFER
- **MTM Business Logic**: Operation numbers as workflow steps ("90", "100", "110", "120")

### **User Interface**
- **Theme System**: 15+ dynamic themes including Light/Dark variants, High Contrast, and color-coded options
- **Component Library**: MTM-branded UI components with purple theme (#6a0dad)
- **Responsive Design**: Modern card-based layouts with proper spacing and accessibility

## Data Flow

### Inventory Operations Flow
1. **User Input** → ViewModel validation → Command execution
2. **Database Operations** → Stored procedure via DatabaseService → Result processing
3. **UI Updates** → Property notifications → View refresh → User feedback

### Service Layer Communication
```
UI Layer (Views/ViewModels)
    ↓
Service Layer (Database, Configuration, Navigation, ErrorHandling)
    ↓
Data Layer (MySQL via stored procedures)
    ↓
Business Logic (MTM-specific rules and validations)
```

### Transaction Processing
- **Add Operations**: User intent → IN transaction → Database update → UI refresh
- **Remove Operations**: User intent → OUT transaction → Validation → Database update
- **Transfer Operations**: User intent → TRANSFER transaction → Location update → Audit trail

## Team and Ownership

### Development Teams
- **Primary Maintainer**: Dorotel (37 commits in last year)
- **AI-Assisted Development**: copilot-swe-agent[bot] (50 commits in last year)
- **Technical Lead**: John Koll (7 commits in last year)

### Code Ownership Patterns
- **Core Infrastructure**: Shared ownership across service layer
