## 🚨 Blockers & Issues

### **Current Blockers**

- None (Planning phase complete)

### **Potential Risks**

- [ ] Universal Service complexity may require additional time
- [ ] View integration may reveal unexpected dependencies
- [ ] Performance optimizations may need testing across platforms

### **Dependencies**

- [ ] MVVM Community Toolkit patterns must be maintained
- [ ] Existing overlay service registrations must remain functional during transition
- [ ] Theme system integration must be preserved
