- **Models Organization**: 71% (5/7 tasks - missing cleanup) 🟡
- **Missing Overlays**: 20% (Models exist, ViewModels needed) 🟡
- **View Integration**: 0% (0/4 tasks - blocked by compilation) 🔴
- **Performance**: 0% (0/4 tasks - blocked by compilation) 🔴

### **By Priority**

- **🔴 CRITICAL**: Fix 235 compilation errors IMMEDIATELY  
- **🟡 High**: Complete namespace updates and model cleanup  
- **🟢 Medium**: Create missing ViewModels and Views
- **🔵 Low**: Testing and documentation updates

### **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**

1. **Fix duplicate model conflicts** (Models exist in both old and new locations)
2. **Update all namespace references** across ViewModels, Services, Views
3. **Fix service interface registrations** in ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL Blockers & Issues

### **IMMEDIATE Blockers (MUST FIX NOW)**

1. **235 Compilation Errors** - Application cannot build
   - Missing `InventoryItem` model references (exists in multiple namespaces)
   - Missing `EditInventoryModel` references (exists in both Models/ and Models/Core/)
   - Missing `SessionTransaction` references (exists in both Models/ and Models/Core/)
   - Missing service interface references (moved to new namespaces)

2. **Duplicate Model Conflicts**
   - Models exist in both old (`Models/`) and new locations (`Models/Core/`, etc.)
   - Compiler cannot resolve which version to use
   - Need to remove old versions after updating all references

3. **Service Interface Resolution Failures**
   - `INavigationService` moved to `Services.Infrastructure` namespace
   - `IInventoryEditingService` moved to `Services.Business` namespace  
   - `IUniversalOverlayService` exists in `Services.Feature` namespace
   - ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs needs namespace updates

### **CRITICAL Dependencies**

- **CANNOT proceed with overlay implementation** until compilation is fixed
- **All development blocked** until namespace references are resolved
- **235 errors must be reduced to 0** before any new development

### **PHASE 1: COMPILATION FIX (THIS WEEK)**

1. **Fix Model Namespace Conflicts** (Priority 1)
   - Remove duplicate models from old `Models/` root location
   - Keep only new organized versions (`Models/Core/`, `Models/UI/`, etc.)
   - Verify all models use new namespace structure

2. **Update All Using Statements** (Priority 1)
   - ViewModels: Update to use `Models.Core`, `Models.UI`, etc.
   - Services: Update to use reorganized service namespaces
   - Views: Update any model references in code-behind

3. **Fix Service Registration** (Priority 1)
   - Update `Extensions/ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs`
   - Register all services with new namespace paths
   - Ensure all interfaces resolve correctly

### **PHASE 2: OVERLAY COMPLETION (NEXT WEEK)**

1. **Create Missing ViewModels** for existing overlay models
2. **Create Missing Views** for overlay system  
3. **Integrate overlays** into main application views
4. **Test overlay functionality** end-to-end

### **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

- ✅ **0 compilation errors** (currently 235)
- ✅ **Application builds successfully**
- ✅ **All services resolve from DI container**  
- ✅ **Basic application functionality works**

### Estimated Timeline

Time Required: 4-6 hours to fix compilation, 2-3 days for overlay completion
