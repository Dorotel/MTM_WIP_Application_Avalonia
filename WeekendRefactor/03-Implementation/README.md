# Implementation Documentation

**Phase**: Universal Overlay System Implementation  
**Purpose**: Step-by-step implementation guides for MTM WIP Application refactoring  

## 📁 Organization

- **`Stages/`** - Phase-by-phase implementation guides
- **`Guides/`** - Comprehensive topic guides  
- **`Templates/`** - Reusable templates and patterns

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. New to overlay implementation? Start with [Complete Tutorial](Guides/Complete-Overlay-Development-Tutorial.md)
2. Ready for full implementation? Follow [Weekend Guide](Weekend-Implementation-Guide.md)
3. Need specific topic help? Browse [Guides/](Guides/) folder
4. Working on specific stage? See [Stages/](Stages/) folder

## 📋 Implementation Sequence

Follow stages in numerical order: Stage1 → Stage2 → Stage3 → Stage4 → Stage5 → Stage6

### Stage 1: Critical Safety Foundation
- Universal service architecture establishment
- Critical safety overlays (Confirmation, Error, Progress)
- Foundation for all other overlay implementations

### Stage 2: Core User Experience Overlays  
- Success feedback and user interaction overlays
- Enhanced user experience foundations
- Basic overlay management systems

### Stage 3: Advanced Feature Overlays
- Advanced editing and management overlays
- Complex user interaction patterns
- Feature-rich overlay implementations

### Stage 4: Integration and Polish
- Cross-overlay communication and management
- Performance optimization and user experience polish
- Final integration with existing MTM systems

## 🔗 Implementation Support

- **Analysis**: [../01-Analysis/](../01-Analysis/README.md) - Foundation analysis and architecture
- **Reorganization**: [../02-Reorganization/](../02-Reorganization/README.md) - Project structure improvements
- **Status**: [../04-Status/](../04-Status/README.md) - Progress tracking and status monitoring
- **Master Plan**: [../Master-Refactor-Implementation-Plan.md](../Master-Refactor-Implementation-Plan.md)

## 🎯 Implementation Philosophy

- **Progressive Enhancement**: Build upon existing MTM foundation without breaking changes
- **Service-Oriented Architecture**: Maintain clean separation between overlay services and business logic  
- **User Experience Focus**: Every overlay implementation prioritizes manufacturing user workflows
- **Performance First**: Ensure overlay implementations don't impact manufacturing operation performance
