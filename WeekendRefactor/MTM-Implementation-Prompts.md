Current ViewModels (scattered organization):
- FilterPanelViewModel.cs.disabled
- PrintLayoutControlViewModel.cs, PrintViewModel.cs
- ThemeEditorViewModel.cs
- Multiple other ViewModels in root folder

Target Structure:
ViewModels/
â”œâ”€â”€ Application/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ MainWindowViewModel.cs
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ApplicationStateViewModel.cs
â”œâ”€â”€ MainForm/

```

### **Prompt 1.3: Views Reorganization and AXAML Validation**

```
Help me reorganize the Views folder to match the ViewModels structure and ensure all AXAML files follow proper Avalonia syntax to prevent AVLN2000 compilation errors.

Current Issues:
- Views scattered in root folder without clear organization
- Need to verify all AXAML uses correct Avalonia namespace
- Ensure no WPF syntax is accidentally used
- Grid definitions must use x:Name not Name property
- All Views must follow MTM design system patterns

Target Views Structure:
Views/
â”œâ”€â”€ Application/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ MainWindow.axaml/.cs
â”œâ”€â”€ MainForm/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ InventoryTabView.axaml/.cs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ RemoveTabView.axaml/.cs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ TransferTabView.axaml/.cs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ AdvancedInventoryView.axaml/.cs
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ AdvancedRemoveView.axaml/.cs
â”œâ”€â”€ Settings/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ SettingsForm.axaml/.cs
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ThemeEditorView.axaml/.cs
â”œâ”€â”€ Print/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ PrintView.axaml/.cs

    â”œâ”€â”€ SuggestionOverlayView.axaml/.cs
    â””â”€â”€ EditInventoryView.axaml/.cs

Critical AXAML Requirements:
- xmlns="https://github.com/avaloniaui" (NOT WPF namespace)
- Use x:Name for Grid definitions (NEVER Name property)
- TextBlock instead of Label
- Use ColumnDefinitions="Auto,*" attribute form
- All MTM theme resources via DynamicResource
- Follow InventoryTabView grid pattern for all tab views

Please scan existing Views, identify AXAML syntax issues, and provide corrected file organization.
```

### **Prompt 1.4: Universal Overlay Service Foundation**

### **Prompt: MTM Theme System Integration with Overlays**

```

Help me ensure all overlays in the MTM WIP Application properly integrate with the MTM theme system and follow the established design patterns.

Current Theme System:

- Primary Color: Windows 11 Blue (#0078D4)  
- Multiple theme support: MTM_Blue, MTM_Green, MTM_Red, MTM_Dark
- ThemeService for theme switching
- Dynamic resource bindings throughout application

Overlay Theme Integration Requirements:

1. Color System:

- Primary actions: #0078D4 (Windows 11 Blue)
- Secondary blue: #106EBE  
- Success: Green variants from MTM theme
- Warning: Amber/Orange from MTM theme  
- Error: Red variants from MTM theme
- Card background: Dynamic white/dark based on theme

2. Resource Bindings:
All overlays must use DynamicResource bindings:

- MTM_Shared_Logic.CardBackgroundBrush
- MTM_Shared_Logic.BorderBrush  
- MTM_Shared_Logic.PrimaryAction
- MTM_Shared_Logic.SuccessBackgroundBrush
- MTM_Shared_Logic.ErrorBrush
- MTM_Shared_Logic.PrimaryTextBrush

3. Design System Consistency:

- Card-based layout with Border controls
- Rounded corners (CornerRadius="8")
- Consistent spacing (8px, 16px, 24px)
- Drop shadows using CardDropShadowEffect
- Proper button styling with MTM colors

4. Theme Switching Support:

- Overlays must update immediately when theme changes
- No hardcoded colors in AXAML or code-behind
- Resource inheritance from parent containers
- Smooth transitions during theme switches

Current Overlays to Update:

- ConfirmationOverlayView.axaml
- SuccessOverlayView.axaml  
- SuggestionOverlayView.axaml
- EditInventoryView.axaml
- Any new overlays created

Implementation Tasks:

1. Audit all existing overlay AXAML for hardcoded colors
2. Replace hardcoded colors with DynamicResource bindings
3. Ensure consistent card-based layout patterns
4. Test theme switching with overlays visible
5. Update overlay templates for future development

Please provide the complete theme integration updates for all overlay AXAML files.

```

### **Prompt: Cross-Platform Testing Setup**

```

Help me set up comprehensive cross-platform testing for the MTM WIP Application, focusing on Windows (primary), with potential Linux and macOS support.

Testing Requirements:

1. Platform Coverage:

2. Test Categories:

- Unit tests (platform-agnostic ViewModels and Services)
- Integration tests (database, service resolution)
- UI tests (Avalonia-specific rendering and interaction)
- Performance tests (memory usage, startup time)

3. Overlay System Testing:

- Overlay display consistency across platforms
- Theme system integration on different OSes
- Keyboard navigation and shortcuts
- Font rendering and text measurement
- Mouse/touch interaction patterns

4. Database Integration Testing:

â””â”€â”€ Integration/
    â”œâ”€â”€ ServiceResolutionTests.cs
    â””â”€â”€ OverlayIntegrationTests.cs
```

Implementation Requirements:

- Use MSTest with platform-specific test categories
- Avalonia UI testing framework for cross-platform UI tests
- Docker containers for Linux testing environment
- Automated CI/CD pipeline integration
- Performance baseline establishment per platform
- Screenshot comparison testing for UI consistency

Testing Scenarios:

1. Application startup and service resolution

## ðŸ“‹ DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW PROMPTS

### **Prompt: Create New Overlay (Template)**

```

Help me create a new overlay for the MTM WIP Application following the established patterns and Universal Overlay Service integration.

New Overlay Specification:

- Overlay Name: [OverlayName]
- Purpose: [Brief description of functionality]
- Parent View: [Which view will use this overlay]
- User Actions: [List of actions user can take]
- Validation Rules: [Input validation requirements]
- Database Operations: [Any stored procedures needed]

Template Implementation:

1. Create request/response models in Models/Overlay/
2. Create ViewModel in ViewModels/Overlay/ with MVVM Community Toolkit
3. Create View AXAML in Views/Overlay/ with MTM design system
4. Create minimal code-behind with keyboard shortcuts
5. Add service registration in Extensions/ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs
6. Add extension methods for Universal Overlay Service
7. Create unit tests in Tests/Unit/ViewModels/Overlay/
8. Add usage example in parent ViewModel

Required Patterns:

- [ObservableObject] with [ObservableProperty] and [RelayCommand]
- BasePoolableOverlayViewModel inheritance for pooling support
- MTM theme system integration with DynamicResource
- Universal Overlay Service request/response pattern
- Stored procedures only for database operations
- Services.ErrorHandling.HandleErrorAsync() for error handling
- Comprehensive validation with real-time feedback

Please create the complete overlay implementation following the MTM patterns.

```

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Reference

### **Most Important Prompts for Getting Started**

1. **Start Here**: Use "Prompt 1.1: Services Consolidation Analysis" to begin reorganization
2. **Foundation**: Use "Prompt 1.4: Universal Overlay Service Foundation" for overlay system
3. **Safety**: Use "Prompt 2.1: Critical Safety Overlays" for manufacturing safety requirements
4. **Template**: Use "Prompt: Create New Overlay (Template)" for adding new overlays
5. **Testing**: Use "Prompt 3.1: Comprehensive Testing Framework" for validation

### **Key MTM Patterns to Remember**

- **ViewModels**: `[ObservableObject]`, `[ObservableProperty]`, `[RelayCommand]`
- **Database**: `Helper_Database_StoredProcedure.ExecuteDataTableWithStatus()` only
- **AXAML**: `x:Name` not `Name`, `xmlns="https://github.com/avaloniaui"`, DynamicResource for colors
- **Colors**: Windows 11 Blue `#0078D4`, MTM theme system via DynamicResource
- **Error Handling**: `await Services.ErrorHandling.HandleErrorAsync(ex, context)`
