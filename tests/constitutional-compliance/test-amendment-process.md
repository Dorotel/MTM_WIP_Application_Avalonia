# Constitutional Amendment Process Validation Test

**Test ID**: T004  
**Test Type**: Contract Test  
**Status**: ðŸ”´ MUST FAIL (TDD Requirement)  
**Date**: September 28, 2025

## Test Objective

Validate that the constitutional amendment process enforces dual approval (Repository Owner + @Agent) and follows proper governance procedures.

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Valid Amendment Request

**Given**: A valid amendment proposal with all required fields  
**When**: Amendment request is submitted  
**Then**: System should accept request and require dual approval  

**Test Data**:

```yaml
amendment_request:
  decision_id: "AMR-001-2025"
  decision_type: "AMENDMENT"
  description: "Update performance threshold for database timeout from 30s to 25s"
  requestor: "development-team"
  rationale: "Manufacturing operations require faster response times for real-time inventory updates"
  impact_assessment: "This change will improve user experience but may require database optimization. Estimated implementation time: 5 days. Risk level: Medium - requires performance testing validation."
  affected_principles: ["Performance Requirements"]
  effective_date: "2025-10-15"
```

**Expected Response**:

```yaml
amendment_response:
  request_id: "AMR-001-2025"
  status: "PENDING"
  approval_required_from: ["Repository Owner", "@Agent"]
  review_timeline: "Within 5 business days"
  next_steps: "Awaiting Repository Owner and @Agent approval"
```

**ðŸ”´ EXPECTED RESULT**: TEST MUST FAIL - Amendment process not implemented yet

### Scenario 2: Invalid Amendment - Missing Required Fields

**Given**: Amendment request missing required impact assessment  
**When**: Amendment request is submitted  
**Then**: System should reject request with validation error  

**Test Data**:

```yaml
amendment_request:
  decision_id: "AMR-002-2025"
  decision_type: "AMENDMENT"
  description: "Add new testing requirement"
  requestor: "development-team"
  rationale: "Improve code quality"
  # Missing: impact_assessment (required, min 200 chars)
  affected_principles: ["Testing Standards"]
```

**Expected Response**:

```yaml
error_response:
  error_code: "VALIDATION_ERROR"
  error_message: "Impact assessment is required and must be at least 200 characters"
  correlation_id: "val-002"
  recovery_suggestions: ["Provide detailed impact assessment with implementation timeline and risk analysis"]
```

**ðŸ”´ EXPECTED RESULT**: TEST MUST FAIL - Validation not implemented yet

### Scenario 3: Dual Approval Workflow

**Given**: Valid amendment request in PENDING status  
**When**: Repository Owner approves the amendment  
**Then**: Status should remain PENDING until @Agent also approves  

**Test Steps**:

1. Submit valid amendment request
2. Repository Owner provides approval
3. Verify status is still PENDING
4. @Agent provides approval  
5. Verify status changes to APPROVED

**ðŸ”´ EXPECTED RESULT**: TEST MUST FAIL - Dual approval workflow not implemented yet

### Scenario 4: Emergency Amendment Process

**Given**: Critical manufacturing issue requiring immediate constitutional change  
**When**: Emergency amendment is requested  
**Then**: System should trigger expedited approval process  

**Test Data**:

```yaml
emergency_amendment:
  decision_id: "EMR-001-2025"
  decision_type: "AMENDMENT"
  emergency: true
  description: "Temporarily reduce database timeout to 15s due to critical manufacturing downtime"
  justification: "Production line stopped - immediate action required"
  requestor: "operations-manager"
```

**Expected Behavior**:

- Immediate Repository Owner notification
- @Agent review within 24 hours
- Temporary implementation allowed pending formal review

**ðŸ”´ EXPECTED RESULT**: TEST MUST FAIL - Emergency process not implemented yet

## Implementation Requirements

These tests define the contract that the amendment process implementation must satisfy:

1. **Amendment Request Validation**: All required fields must be present and meet minimum length requirements
2. **Dual Approval Enforcement**: Both Repository Owner and @Agent approval required for all amendments
3. **Status Tracking**: Clear status progression from PENDING â†’ APPROVED â†’ IMPLEMENTED
4. **Timeline Enforcement**: 5 business day review period, 30-day implementation timeline
5. **Emergency Procedures**: Expedited process for critical manufacturing issues
6. **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of all amendment activities

## Test Execution Status

- [x] Test scenarios defined
- [ ] Amendment process implemented
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Integration with CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Repository Owner approval workflow
- [ ] @Agent approval workflow

**CRITICAL**: These tests must remain FAILING until the amendment process is fully implemented according to constitutional requirements.
