  severity: "CRITICAL"
```

**Expected Response**:

```yaml
violation_response:
  violation_id: "perf-viol-001"
  status: "VIOLATION"
  recommendations: [
    "Optimize query performance with proper indexing",
    "Consider breaking complex query into smaller operations",
    "Review stored procedure efficiency",

```

**ðŸ”´ EXPECTED RESULT**: TEST MUST FAIL - Session memory monitoring not implemented yet

### Scenario 4: UI Responsiveness Validation

1. **Rapid Part ID Entry**: Operator entering 50 part IDs in 2 minutes
2. **Concurrent Operations**: Multiple background operations while UI interaction
3. **Large Dataset Loading**: Loading 10,000+ inventory records while maintaining UI responsiveness
4. **Multi-Tab Operations**: Switching between multiple inventory tabs rapidly

**Expected UI Metrics**:

```yaml
ui_responsiveness_metrics:
  frame_rate_average: 32
  frame_rate_minimum: 28
  input_lag_average: 78
  input_lag_maximum: 95
  ui_thread_blocking_events: 0
  background_operation_impact: 3.2
```

**ðŸ”´ EXPECTED RESULT**: TEST MUST FAIL - UI responsiveness monitoring not implemented yet

### Scenario 5: Cross-Platform Performance Consistency

**Given**: Same operations running on Windows, macOS, and Linux  
**When**: Performance is measured across platforms  
**Then**: Performance variance should be <5% per constitutional requirement  

**Test Matrix**:

```yaml
cross_platform_performance:
  operation: "inventory_search_1000_records"
  platforms:
    windows:
      average_time: 1.23
      memory_usage: 45
