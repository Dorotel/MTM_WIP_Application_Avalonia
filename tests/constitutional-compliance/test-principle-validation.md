## Test Execution Framework

### Running Constitutional Principle Tests

```powershell
# Run all constitutional compliance tests
dotnet test --filter Category=ConstitutionalCompliance

# Run specific principle tests
dotnet test --filter Category=CodeQuality
dotnet test --filter Category=TestingStandards
dotnet test --filter Category=UXConsistency
dotnet test --filter Category=Performance

# Generate coverage report
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage" --filter Category=ConstitutionalCompliance
```

### Continuous Integration Integration

These tests are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline and run automatically on:

- Pull request creation
- Push to main branches
- Scheduled daily validation
- Pre-deployment verification

### Test Failure Handling

When constitutional principle tests fail:

1. **Block Deployment**: Failed tests prevent deployment to production
2. **Generate Report**: Detailed failure report with remediation steps
3. **Notify Team**: Automated notifications for constitutional violations
4. **Track Compliance**: Compliance metrics tracked and reported

## Expected Test Evolution

### Phase 1: Initial Failure (Current)

- All tests designed to fail until constitutional implementation
- Provides clear target for implementation work
- Establishes baseline for constitutional compliance

### Phase 2: Principle Implementation

- Tests begin passing as constitutional principles implemented
- Gradual improvement in compliance scores
- Real-time feedback on implementation progress

### Phase 3: Full Compliance

- All constitutional principle tests passing
- Continuous monitoring for regression
- Automated compliance reporting and badges

## Constitutional Compliance Scoring

### Scoring Formula

```bash
Compliance Score = (Passing Tests / Total Tests) × 100
```

### Compliance Levels

```bash
- Full Compliance: 90-100%
- Substantial Compliance: 75-89%
- Partial Compliance: 60-74%
- Non-Compliance: Below 60%
- **90-100%**: Full Constitutional Compliance
- **75-89%**: Substantial Compliance (Minor Issues)
- **60-74%**: Partial Compliance (Major Issues)
- **Below 60%**: Constitutional Non-Compliance (Blocking)
```

### Reporting

- Daily compliance reports generated
- Trend analysis over time
- Compliance badges updated automatically
- Non-compliance alerts to development team
