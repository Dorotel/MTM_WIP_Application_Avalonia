**Test ID**: T009  
**Test Type**: Integration Test  
**Status**: ðŸ”´ MUST FAIL (TDD Requirement)  
**Date**: September 28, 2025

## Test Objective

Validate that the 30-day legacy code compliance system correctly identifies, prioritizes, and tracks legacy code migration to constitutional standards with @Agent-optimized development acceleration.

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Legacy Code Discovery and Assessment

**Given**: Existing codebase with legacy patterns  
**When**: Legacy compliance assessment is performed  
**Then**: System should identify all constitutional violations and create migration plan  

**Legacy Code Examples to Detect**:

```csharp
// Legacy Pattern 1: ReactiveUI (prohibited)
public class LegacyViewModel : ReactiveObject
{
    private string _property;
    public string Property
    {
        get => _property;
        set => this.RaiseAndSetIfChanged(ref _property, value);
    }
}

// Legacy Pattern 2: Direct database access (should use stored procedures)
public class LegacyDataService
{
    public void SaveData(string sql)
    {
        using var connection = new MySqlConnection(connectionString);
        connection.Execute(sql); // Direct SQL - should use stored procedures
    }
}

// Legacy Pattern 3: No error handling (should use centralized)
public class LegacyService
{
    public void DoWork()
    {
        // No try-catch, no error handling
        var result = SomeOperation();
    }
}
```

**Expected Assessment Results**:

```yaml
legacy_assessment:
  total_files_scanned: 156
  constitutional_violations:
    code_quality_violations: 23
    testing_gaps: 45
    ux_inconsistencies: 12
    performance_issues: 8
  compliance_score: 68  # Out of 100
  estimated_migration_effort: "18 days"
  priority_items: [
    {
      file: "ViewModels/LegacyInventoryViewModel.cs",
      violation: "ReactiveUI usage - critical constitutional violation",
      effort: "4 hours",
      priority: "HIGH"
    }
  ]
```

**ðŸ”´ EXPECTED RESULT**: TEST MUST FAIL - Legacy code assessment not implemented yet

### Scenario 2: 30-Day Compliance Timeline Generation

**When**: Compliance timeline is generated  
**Then**: System should create realistic 30-day migration schedule with daily milestones  

**Expected Timeline Structure**:

```yaml
compliance_timeline:
  total_duration: "30 days"
  start_date: "2025-09-28"
  completion_date: "2025-10-28"
  daily_milestones:
    day_1:
      target: "Migrate critical ReactiveUI ViewModels (5 files)"
      estimated_effort: "8 hours"
      success_criteria: "All ViewModels use [ObservableObject] pattern"
    day_2:
      target: "Convert direct SQL to stored procedure calls (8 files)"

### Scenario 4: Priority-Based Migration Strategy

**Given**: Large legacy codebase with multiple violation types  
**When**: Migration prioritization is applied  
**Then**: Critical manufacturing operations should be migrated first  

**Prioritization Matrix**:

```yaml
migration_priorities:
  critical_manufacturing_operations:
    - "Inventory management ViewModels (operations 90, 100, 110, 120)"
    - "Transaction processing services"
    - "Real-time data synchronization"
    priority: "HIGH"
    timeline: "Days 1-7"
  business_logic_services:
    - "Master data services"
    - "Reporting and analytics"
    - "Configuration management"
    priority: "MEDIUM"
    timeline: "Days 8-21"
  ui_and_presentation:
    - "Theme and styling consistency"
    - "Non-critical UI components"
    - "Accessibility improvements"
    priority: "LOW"
    timeline: "Days 22-30"
```

**Manufacturing Impact Assessment**:

- **Zero Downtime Requirement**: Critical operations migrated during maintenance windows
- **Session Continuity**: 8+ hour sessions not interrupted during migration
- **Rollback Planning**: Each migration phase has immediate rollback capability

**ðŸ”´ EXPECTED RESULT**: TEST MUST FAIL - Priority-based migration not implemented yet

### Scenario 5: Daily Progress Tracking and Milestone Validation

**Given**: Active 30-day compliance migration  
**When**: Daily progress is tracked  
**Then**: System should validate milestone completion and adjust timeline as needed  

**Daily Tracking Requirements**:

```yaml
daily_progress_tracking:
  day_5_checkpoint:
    planned_milestones:
      - "5 ViewModels migrated to MVVM Community Toolkit"
      - "8 services converted to stored procedures"
      - "15 error handling implementations added"
    actual_progress:
      viewmodels_migrated: 4
      services_converted: 8
      error_handling_added: 12
    compliance_score_change:
      baseline: 68
      current: 75
      target: 78
    timeline_adjustment:
      status: "SLIGHTLY_BEHIND"
      action: "Allocate additional resources to ViewModel migration"
      revised_completion: "2025-10-29" # 1 day extension
```

**Milestone Validation Criteria**:

- **Code Compilation**: All migrated code must compile successfully

    validation:
      - "Database integration test generation"
      - "Parameter validation"
      - "Result parsing verification"
```

**ðŸ”´ EXPECTED RESULT**: TEST MUST FAIL - Automated migration tools not implemented yet

## Manufacturing-Specific Compliance Requirements

### Scenario 7: Manufacturing Operations Continuity During Migration

**Given**: Active manufacturing operations during compliance migration  
**When**: Legacy code migration affects manufacturing workflows  
**Then**: Zero-downtime migration strategies should be applied  

**Continuity Requirements**:

- **Operations 90, 100, 110, 120**: Must remain functional during migration
- **Inventory Transactions**: No data loss or corruption during migration
- **Session Persistence**: Active 8+ hour sessions must not be interrupted
- **Real-Time Synchronization**: Manufacturing data sync cannot be disrupted

**Migration Strategies**:

```yaml
zero_downtime_migration:
  blue_green_deployment:
    - "Deploy migrated components alongside legacy"
    - "Gradual traffic shifting to migrated components"
    - "Instant rollback capability if issues detected"
  feature_flags:
    - "Toggle between legacy and migrated implementations"
    - "Per-operation or per-user migration control"
    - "Real-time migration status monitoring"
  database_versioning:
    - "Stored procedure versioning for backward compatibility"
    - "Gradual migration of database access patterns"
    - "Transaction integrity maintenance"
```

**ðŸ”´ EXPECTED RESULT**: TEST MUST FAIL - Zero-downtime migration not implemented yet

### Scenario 8: Cross-Platform Legacy Compliance

**Given**: Legacy code affecting multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android)  
**When**: Cross-platform compliance migration is performed  
**Then**: All platforms should achieve constitutional compliance simultaneously  

**Cross-Platform Migration Challenges**:

- **Platform-Specific Code**: Windows-only implementations need cross-platform alternatives
- **Performance Variance**: Ensure <5% performance variance across platforms after migration
- **UI Consistency**: Avalonia UI patterns must be consistent across all platforms
- **Testing Coverage**: Cross-platform testing for all migrated components

**ðŸ”´ EXPECTED RESULT**: TEST MUST FAIL - Cross-platform compliance migration not implemented yet

## Compliance Validation and Reporting

### Scenario 9: Final Compliance Validation

**Given**: 30-day migration timeline completion  
**When**: Final compliance validation is performed  
**Then**: System should verify 100% constitutional compliance achievement  

**Final Validation Requirements**:

```yaml
final_compliance_validation:
  constitutional_principles:
    code_quality_excellence:
      score: 100
      violations: 0
      validation: "All code uses .NET 8.0, MVVM Community Toolkit, centralized error handling"
    testing_standards:
      score: 95
      violations: 2  # Minor gaps acceptable
      validation: "80%+ test coverage, comprehensive integration tests"
    ux_consistency:
      score: 100
      violations: 0
      validation: "Avalonia UI 11.3.4, Material Design, theme consistency"
    performance_requirements:
      score: 98
      violations: 1  # Minor performance optimization opportunity
      validation: "<30s database timeout, <100ms UI lag, 8+ hour session stability"
  overall_compliance: 98.25
  certification: "CONSTITUTIONAL_COMPLIANCE_ACHIEVED"
```

**ðŸ”´ EXPECTED RESULT**: TEST MUST FAIL - Final validation system not implemented yet

### Scenario 10: Post-Migration Monitoring and Maintenance

**Given**: Successfully migrated legacy code  
**When**: Post-migration monitoring is active  
**Then**: System should prevent constitutional regression and maintain compliance  

**Ongoing Compliance Monitoring**:

- **CI/CD Integration**: Every pull request validated against constitutional requirements
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous performance tracking for regression detection
- **Compliance Scoring**: Regular compliance assessments to prevent degradation
- **Alert System**: Immediate alerts for any constitutional violations

**ðŸ”´ EXPECTED RESULT**: TEST MUST FAIL - Post-migration monitoring not implemented yet
