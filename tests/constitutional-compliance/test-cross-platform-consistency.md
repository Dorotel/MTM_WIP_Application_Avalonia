## Cross-Platform Compliance Scoring

### Platform Consistency Formula

```
Cross-Platform Consistency = (Consistent Features / Total Features) × 100
```

### Platform Readiness Levels

- **95-100%**: Production Ready (All Platforms)
- **85-94%**: Multi-Platform Ready (Minor Platform Differences)
- **70-84%**: Primary Platform Ready (Major Platform Issues)
- **Below 70%**: Single Platform Only (Cross-Platform Non-Compliance)

### Compliance Tracking

- **Feature Parity**: Percentage of features working identically across platforms
- **Performance Parity**: Relative performance consistency across platforms
- **UI Consistency**: Visual and interaction consistency scores
- **Integration Quality**: Platform-specific integration success rates

## Expected Evolution

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)

- Tests fail until cross-platform implementation complete
- Establishes platform compatibility requirements
- Provides framework for cross-platform validation

### Phase 2: Primary Platforms
