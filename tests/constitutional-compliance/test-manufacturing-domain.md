# Manufacturing Domain Rule Validation Tests

## Overview

This test suite validates that manufacturing domain business rules are properly implemented and enforced throughout the MTM WIP Application, ensuring operational integrity for 8+ hour manufacturing sessions.

## Manufacturing Context

### Core Manufacturing Operations

- **Operation 90**: Move operations between locations
- **Operation 100**: Receive operations from suppliers  
- **Operation 110**: Ship operations to customers
- **Operation 120**: Transfer operations between facilities

### Valid Location Codes

- **FLOOR**: Main production floor storage
- **RECEIVING**: Incoming material staging area
- **SHIPPING**: Outbound shipment staging area
- **Custom Locations**: Site-specific location codes

### Transaction Types

- **IN**: Adding inventory to system
- **OUT**: Removing inventory from system  
- **TRANSFER**: Moving inventory between locations

## Test Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- Establishes clear business rule requirements
- Provides target for manufacturing feature development

### Phase 2: Implementation Validation

- Tests begin passing as manufacturing features implemented

- Performance benchmarks established

### Phase 3: Operational Validation

- Full manufacturing workflow testing
- Extended session validation
- Production-ready performance confirmation

## Manufacturing Compliance Scoring

### Business Rule Compliance Formula

```bash
$$
\text{Manufacturing Compliance} = \left( \frac{\text{Passing Manufacturing Tests}}{\text{Total Manufacturing Tests}} \right) \times 100
$$

```

### Operational Readiness Levels

```bash
$$
\text{Operational Readiness} = \left( \frac{\text{Passing Operational Tests}}{\text{Total Operational Tests}} \right) \times 100
$$
```

Manufacturing domain compliance directly impacts constitutional compliance scores and deployment readiness.
