# Constitutional Compliance Check Validation Test

**Test ID**: T005  
**Test Type**: Contract Test  
**Status**: ðŸ”´ MUST FAIL (TDD Requirement)  
**Date**: September 28, 2025

## Test Objective

Validate that the constitutional compliance checking system correctly evaluates all pull requests against the four core principles and provides actionable feedback.

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Fully Compliant Pull Request

**Given**: A pull request that adheres to all constitutional principles  
**When**: Compliance check is executed  
**Then**: System should return PASS status with no violations  

**Test Data**:

```yaml
compliance_check_request:
  pull_request_id: "PR-123"
  branch_name: "feature/constitutional-compliant-code"
  changed_files: [
    "src/ViewModels/InventoryViewModel.cs",
    "src/Services/InventoryService.cs",
    "tests/ViewModels/InventoryViewModelTests.cs"
  ]
  commit_sha: "abc123def456"
  validation_scope: "FULL"
```

**Expected Response**:

```yaml
compliance_check_response:
  validation_id: "val-123"
  overall_status: "PASS"
  principle_results:
    code_quality:
      status: "PASS"
      violations: []
      score: 95
    testing_standards:
      status: "PASS"
      coverage_percentage: 85
      missing_tests: []
    user_experience:
      status: "PASS"
      accessibility_issues: []
      responsive_design_check: true
    performance:
      status: "PASS"
      benchmark_results: []
      memory_usage: 128
  enforcement_actions: []
  remediation_steps: []
```

**ðŸ”´ EXPECTED RESULT**: TEST MUST FAIL - Compliance checking system not implemented yet

### Scenario 2: Code Quality Violations

**Given**: A pull request with ReactiveUI patterns (prohibited)  
**When**: Compliance check is executed  
**Then**: System should return FAIL status with specific code quality violations  

**Test Data**:

```yaml
compliance_check_request:
  pull_request_id: "PR-124"
  branch_name: "feature/reactive-ui-violation"
  changed_files: ["src/ViewModels/ProblematicViewModel.cs"]
  commit_sha: "def456abc789"
  validation_scope: "FULL"
```

**Expected Response**:

```yaml
compliance_check_response:
  validation_id: "val-124"
  overall_status: "FAIL"
  principle_results:
    code_quality:
      status: "FAIL"
      violations: [
        {
          principle: "Code Quality Excellence",
          severity: "CRITICAL",
          file_path: "src/ViewModels/ProblematicViewModel.cs",
          line_number: 15,
          description: "ReactiveUI patterns are prohibited - use MVVM Community Toolkit instead",
          suggested_fix: "Replace ReactiveObject with [ObservableObject] attribute",
          constitutional_reference: "Article I, Section 1.1.1"
        }
      ]
      score: 25
  enforcement_actions: ["BLOCK_MERGE"]
  remediation_steps: [
    "Remove ReactiveUI dependencies",
    "Implement MVVM Community Toolkit patterns",
    "Update all ViewModels to use [ObservableProperty] and [RelayCommand]"
  ]
```

**ðŸ”´ EXPECTED RESULT**: TEST MUST FAIL - Code quality violation detection not implemented yet

### Scenario 3: Testing Standards Insufficient

**Given**: A pull request with less than 80% test coverage  
**When**: Compliance check is executed  
**Then**: System should return FAIL status with testing violations  

**Expected Violations**:

- Test coverage below constitutional minimum (80%)
- Missing unit tests for new ViewModels
- No integration tests for new services
- Missing UI automation tests for new workflows

**ðŸ”´ EXPECTED RESULT**: TEST MUST FAIL - Test coverage analysis not implemented yet

### Scenario 4: Performance Requirement Violations

**Given**: A pull request with database operations exceeding 30-second timeout  
**When**: Performance analysis is executed  
**Then**: System should detect timeout violations  

**Expected Performance Violations**:

```yaml
benchmark_result:
  metric_name: "database_operation_timeout"
  measured_value: 45
  target_value: 30
  maximum_value: 30
  unit: "seconds"
  status: "FAIL"
  platform: "Windows"
```

**ðŸ”´ EXPECTED RESULT**: TEST MUST FAIL - Performance monitoring not implemented yet

### Scenario 5: Manufacturing Domain Rule Violations

**Given**: A pull request with invalid manufacturing operations  
**When**: Domain validation is executed  
**Then**: System should detect manufacturing rule violations  

**Test Data**:

- Invalid operation number "95" (only 90, 100, 110, 120 allowed)
- Invalid location code "INVALID_LOC" (only FLOOR, RECEIVING, SHIPPING allowed)
- Invalid transaction type "UNKNOWN" (only IN, OUT, TRANSFER allowed)

**ðŸ”´ EXPECTED RESULT**: TEST MUST FAIL - Manufacturing domain validation not implemented yet

## Cross-Platform Compliance Testing

### Scenario 6: Platform-Specific Code Detection

**Given**: Code containing Windows-specific APIs  
**When**: Cross-platform validation is executed  
**Then**: System should flag platform-specific violations  

**Violation Examples**:

- `System.Windows` namespace usage
- `Microsoft.Win32` registry access
- Windows-only file paths with backslashes
- WinForms controls

**ðŸ”´ EXPECTED RESULT**: TEST MUST FAIL - Cross-platform validation not implemented yet

## Integration Testing Requirements

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration

**Test Requirements**:

1. Automated execution on all pull requests
2. Blocking failed compliance checks
3. Detailed violation reports in PR comments
4. Integration with GitHub status checks
5. Performance benchmark tracking over time

**ðŸ”´ EXPECTED RESULT**: All integration tests must fail until full implementation

## Constitutional Alignment Verification

### Article I: Code Quality Excellence

- âœ… .NET 8.0 requirement validation
- âœ… Nullable reference types enforcement
- âœ… MVVM Community Toolkit pattern validation
- âœ… ReactiveUI prohibition enforcement
- âœ… Centralized error handling validation

### Article II: Testing Standards

- âœ… 80% minimum test coverage enforcement
- âœ… Unit test pattern validation
- âœ… Integration test requirement checking
- âœ… UI automation test validation
- âœ… Cross-platform test coverage verification

### Article III: UX Consistency

- âœ… Avalonia UI 11.3.4 version validation
- âœ… Material Design icon usage verification
- âœ… Theme system integration checking
- âœ… Responsive design validation
- âœ… Accessibility compliance verification

### Article IV: Performance Requirements

- âœ… Database timeout validation (30 seconds max)
- âœ… Memory usage monitoring (512MB max)
- âœ… UI responsiveness validation (100ms max input lag)
- âœ… Startup time validation (10 seconds max)
- âœ… Session performance validation (8+ hours)

## Test Execution Status

- [x] Test scenarios defined
- [ ] Compliance validation system implemented
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] CI/CD integration complete
- [ ] Violation detection working
- [ ] Remediation guidance functional

**CRITICAL**: These tests must remain FAILING until the compliance validation system is fully implemented according to constitutional requirements.
