# Repository Owner + @Agent Dual Approval Workflow Test

**Test ID**: T007  
**Test Type**: Integration Test  
**Status**: ðŸ”´ MUST FAIL (TDD Requirement)  
**Date**: September 28, 2025

## Test Objective

Validate that the dual approval workflow correctly enforces Repository Owner and @Agent approval requirements for all constitutional amendments and critical decisions.

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Sequential Approval Workflow

**Given**: A constitutional amendment requiring dual approval  
**When**: Repository Owner approves first, then @Agent approves  
**Then**: Amendment should progress through approval states correctly  

**Test Steps**:

1. Submit amendment request
2. Verify initial status: PENDING
3. Repository Owner provides approval
4. Verify status: PENDING (still waiting for @Agent)
5. @Agent provides approval
6. Verify status: APPROVED
7. Verify implementation timeline triggered (30 days)

**Expected Workflow States**:

```yaml
workflow_progression:
  initial_state:
    status: "PENDING"
    approvals_required: ["Repository Owner", "@Agent"]
    approvals_received: []
  after_repo_owner_approval:
    status: "PENDING"
    approvals_required: ["@Agent"]
    approvals_received: ["Repository Owner"]
  after_agent_approval:
    status: "APPROVED"
    approvals_required: []
    approvals_received: ["Repository Owner", "@Agent"]
    implementation_deadline: "2025-10-28"
```

**ðŸ”´ EXPECTED RESULT**: TEST MUST FAIL - Dual approval workflow not implemented yet

### Scenario 2: Reverse Order Approval (@Agent First)

**Given**: A constitutional amendment requiring dual approval  
**When**: @Agent approves first, then Repository Owner approves  
**Then**: Amendment should progress correctly regardless of approval order  

**Test Steps**:

1. Submit amendment request
2. @Agent provides approval first
3. Verify status: PENDING (still waiting for Repository Owner)
4. Repository Owner provides approval
5. Verify status: APPROVED

**ðŸ”´ EXPECTED RESULT**: TEST MUST FAIL - Order-independent approval workflow not implemented yet

### Scenario 3: Single Approval Insufficient

**Given**: A constitutional amendment requiring dual approval  
**When**: Only Repository Owner approves (without @Agent approval)  
**Then**: Amendment should remain in PENDING status indefinitely  

**Test Verification**:

- Amendment remains PENDING after 24 hours
- Implementation timeline not triggered
- Reminder notifications sent to @Agent
- No constitutional changes applied

**ðŸ”´ EXPECTED RESULT**: TEST MUST FAIL - Single approval blocking not implemented yet

### Scenario 4: Approval Revocation

**Given**: Amendment with one approval already granted  
**When**: The approver revokes their approval  
**Then**: Amendment should return to appropriate pending state  

**Test Cases**:

1. **Repository Owner Revocation**: After Repository Owner approval, revoke it
2. **@Agent Revocation**: After @Agent approval, revoke it
3. **Double Revocation**: Both approvers revoke (back to initial PENDING)

**Expected Behavior**:

```yaml
revocation_workflow:
  original_state:
    approvals_received: ["Repository Owner", "@Agent"]
    status: "APPROVED"
  after_repo_owner_revocation:
    approvals_received: ["@Agent"]
    status: "PENDING"
    approvals_required: ["Repository Owner"]
  after_agent_revocation:
    approvals_received: []
    status: "PENDING"
    approvals_required: ["Repository Owner", "@Agent"]
```

**ðŸ”´ EXPECTED RESULT**: TEST MUST FAIL - Approval revocation system not implemented yet

### Scenario 5: Conditional Approval with Requirements

**Given**: Amendment with conditional approval from @Agent  
**When**: Repository Owner provides final approval  
**Then**: System should verify conditions are met before final approval  

**Test Data**:

```yaml
conditional_approval:
  approver: "@Agent"
  decision: "APPROVE"
  conditions: [
    "Performance impact assessment must be completed",
    "Backward compatibility analysis required",
    "Manufacturing domain expert review needed"
  ]
  approval_rationale: "Approved pending completion of specified conditions"
```

**Verification Requirements**:

- All conditions must be explicitly marked as completed
- Repository Owner must acknowledge condition completion
- Final approval only granted after condition verification

**ðŸ”´ EXPECTED RESULT**: TEST MUST FAIL - Conditional approval system not implemented yet

## Authority Validation Tests

### Scenario 6: Invalid Approver Rejection

**Given**: Amendment approval attempt by unauthorized user  
**When**: Non-authorized user tries to approve amendment  
**Then**: System should reject approval with authorization error  

**Test Cases**:

1. **Development Team Member**: Should be rejected
2. **External Contributor**: Should be rejected
3. **Automated System**: Should be rejected (unless properly authorized)
4. **Unknown User**: Should be rejected

**Expected Error Response**:

```yaml
authorization_error:
  error_code: "AUTHORIZATION_DENIED"
  error_message: "Only Repository Owner and @Agent can approve constitutional amendments"
  attempted_approver: "unauthorized-user"
  required_approvers: ["Repository Owner", "@Agent"]
  recovery_suggestions: [
    "Contact Repository Owner for approval",
    "Request @Agent review and approval"
  ]
```

**ðŸ”´ EXPECTED RESULT**: TEST MUST FAIL - Authorization validation not implemented yet

### Scenario 7: Approval Notification System

**Given**: Amendment submitted requiring dual approval  
**When**: Approval status changes occur  
**Then**: Appropriate notifications should be sent to relevant parties  

**Notification Requirements**:

```yaml
notification_matrix:
  amendment_submitted:
    notify: ["Repository Owner", "@Agent"]
    message: "New constitutional amendment requires your approval"
  first_approval_received:
    notify: ["remaining-approver", "amendment-requestor"]
    message: "One approval received, awaiting second approval"
  fully_approved:
    notify: ["all-stakeholders", "development-team"]
    message: "Amendment approved - implementation timeline: 30 days"
  approval_revoked:
    notify: ["Repository Owner", "@Agent", "amendment-requestor"]
    message: "Approval revoked - amendment returned to pending status"
```

**ðŸ”´ EXPECTED RESULT**: TEST MUST FAIL - Notification system not implemented yet

## Integration with Constitutional Framework

### Scenario 8: Amendment Impact Assessment Validation

**Given**: Amendment requiring detailed impact assessment  
**When**: Dual approval process evaluates the amendment  
**Then**: Both approvers must validate impact assessment completeness  

**Impact Assessment Requirements**:

- **Repository Owner Focus**: Business impact, resource requirements, timeline feasibility
- **@Agent Focus**: Technical feasibility, architectural impact, implementation complexity
- **Dual Validation**: Both perspectives must concur on assessment accuracy

**ðŸ”´ EXPECTED RESULT**: TEST MUST FAIL - Impact assessment validation not implemented yet

### Scenario 9: Emergency Amendment Dual Approval

**Given**: Critical manufacturing issue requiring emergency amendment  
**When**: Emergency approval process is triggered  
**Then**: Expedited dual approval should maintain authority requirements  

**Emergency Process Requirements**:

1. **Immediate Repository Owner Notification**: Alert sent within 5 minutes
2. **@Agent Expedited Review**: Review required within 24 hours
3. **Temporary Implementation**: Allowed pending formal approval
4. **Post-Emergency Review**: Full approval process within 5 business days

**ðŸ”´ EXPECTED RESULT**: TEST MUST FAIL - Emergency dual approval process not implemented yet

## Manufacturing Domain Integration

### Scenario 10: Manufacturing-Critical Amendment Approval

**Given**: Amendment affecting critical manufacturing operations  
**When**: Dual approval process evaluates manufacturing impact  
**Then**: Additional manufacturing domain validation should be required  

**Manufacturing-Specific Validations**:

- **Operations Impact**: Effect on operations 90, 100, 110, 120
- **Location Dependencies**: Impact on FLOOR, RECEIVING, SHIPPING workflows
- **Transaction Integrity**: Effect on IN, OUT, TRANSFER processes
- **Session Continuity**: Impact on 8+ hour manufacturing sessions
- **Zero-Downtime Requirement**: Validation of seamless deployment

**Enhanced Approval Requirements**:

```yaml
manufacturing_amendment_approval:
  standard_approvers: ["Repository Owner", "@Agent"]
  additional_validations:
    manufacturing_domain_expert: "required"
    production_impact_assessment: "required"
    rollback_plan: "required"
    zero_downtime_validation: "required"
```

**ðŸ”´ EXPECTED RESULT**: TEST MUST FAIL - Manufacturing-specific dual approval not implemented yet

## Test Integration Requirements

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration

**Automated Workflow Requirements**:

1. **Amendment Detection**: Automatic detection of constitutional changes
2. **Approval Status Checking**: CI/CD pipeline waits for dual approval
3. **Implementation Blocking**: No deployment until approval received
4. **Status Reporting**: Continuous status updates in pull requests

**ðŸ”´ EXPECTED RESULT**: All CI/CD integration tests must fail until implementation

### GitHub Integration

**GitHub Workflow Requirements**:

1. **Pull Request Protection**: Constitutional changes require dual approval
2. **Status Checks**: Approval status visible in GitHub interface
3. **Review Assignment**: Automatic reviewer assignment to Repository Owner and @Agent
4. **Merge Blocking**: Prevent merge until dual approval received

**ðŸ”´ EXPECTED RESULT**: All GitHub integration tests must fail until implementation
