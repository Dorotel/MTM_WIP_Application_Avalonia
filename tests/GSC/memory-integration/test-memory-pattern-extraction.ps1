# GSC Memory Pattern Extraction Test
# Date: September 28, 2025
# Purpose: Memory pattern extraction and relevance matching for GSC commands
# CRITICAL: This test MUST FAIL initially - no implementation exists yet (TDD requirement)

<#
.SYNOPSIS
Memory pattern extraction test for GSC memory integration system

.DESCRIPTION
Tests memory pattern extraction, relevance matching, and context-aware
pattern selection for GSC command enhancement.

This test must FAIL initially as required by TDD approach.
