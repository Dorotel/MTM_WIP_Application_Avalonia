# GSC Memory Integration Performance Test
# Date: September 28, 2025
# Purpose: Memory integration performance validation with <5s target
# CRITICAL: This test MUST FAIL initially - no implementation exists yet (TDD requirement)

<#
.SYNOPSIS
Memory integration performance test for GSC enhancement system

.DESCRIPTION
Tests memory integration performance including file reading, pattern extraction,
and context matching within the 5-second constitutional requirement.

This test must FAIL initially as required by TDD approach.
