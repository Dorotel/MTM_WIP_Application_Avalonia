Critical Questions Before Creating YAML Templates
1. Business Logic & Integration Questions
Q1: For transaction logging in QuickButtons.cs History Panel:

Should ALL successful operations (saves, transfers, removals) appear in the QuickButtons history panel? Yes
Is the color coding: Green = IN (inventory adds), Yellow = TRANSFER, Red = OUT (removals) correct? Yes
Should failed operations also appear in history with different styling? No

Q2: For TRANSFER transaction types:


I see from the documentation that ALL transfers create "TRANSFER" transactions regardless of operation number. Is this still correct for the Avalonia version? Yes, Operation numbers have nothing to do with the type of transaction is being made its just a number

Should operation numbers ("90", "100", "110") still be treated as workflow steps only, not transaction type indicators? yes, same reason as last question

Q3: For SuccessOverlayView integration:

Should the success overlay show for ALL successful operations (save, transfer, remove) or only specific ones? All
What specific information should be displayed in the success overlay (quantity, part ID, operation, etc.)? For IN - Part ID, Operation, Location.  For TRANSFER - Part ID, Operation, From Location, To Locaiton, OUT - Same as IN
2. UI Architecture & Dependencies Questions
Q4: For SuggestionOverlay implementation:

Should ALL TextBoxes for Part ID, Operation, Location, and User have suggestion overlays? yes but use the same logic that InventoryTabView uses to activate them
Should the suggestion overlay work the same way as in InventoryTabView (fuzzy matching, keyboard navigation)? Yes
Q5: For DataGrid vs form-based input:

Based on the screenshots, should RemoveTabView and TransferTabView have DataGrid-centric layouts like the WinForms version? - DataGrid

Should the input fields be above the DataGrid for searching/filtering, or alongside for direct entry? Above for search / filtering
Q6: For QuickButtonsView integration:

Should clicking a QuickButton entry populate the form fields in these views the same way it does in InventoryTabView? Yes
Should the QuickButtons panel be visible/togglable in all four views? Yes

3. Advanced Features & Validation Questions
Q7: For AdvancedInventoryView vs InventoryTabView:

Should AdvancedInventoryView save to QuickButtons the same way as InventoryTabView? Yes
What makes it "advanced" - bulk operations, Excel import/export, or different UI layout? Bulk Operations, Do not add Excel Import / Export.
Q8: For AdvancedRemoveView features:

Should it have undo functionality beyond the standard RemoveTabView? Yes the undo capabilies should be View-Based , not app based
Should it support bulk/batch removal operations? Yes
Q9: For validation and error handling:

Should these views use the same validation patterns as InventoryTabView (database validation, quantity checks, etc.)? Yes
Should errors be handled through the centralized ErrorHandling service? Yes

4. YAML Template Structure Questions
Q10: For template complexity:

Should each YAML template be as comprehensive as the theme editor template (with detailed questionnaires)? Yes
Do you want separate sections for each major feature area (UI layout, business logic, integrations)? Yes

Q11: For implementation priority:

Should the YAML templates include priority levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low) for different features? Yes
Which view should be implemented first (based on business priority)? RemoveTabView, then TransferTabView, then AdvancedInventoryView then AdvancedRemoveView

5. Technical Implementation Questions
Q12: For progress reporting:

Should progress be shown in MainView.axaml's status bar for all long-running operations? Yes
Should there be progress indication for database operations, file operations, or both? Both
Q13: For theme consistency:

Should all four views follow the exact same styling patterns as InventoryTabView? Yes - without exception
Are there any view-specific styling requirements based on their function? Yes - The current implementation of AdvancedRemoveTab incorperates the use of the Collapsable panel and an additional Panel on the right side that is not in the documentation, i still want this implemented.  The colapsable panels in RemoveTabView are in working order and I want that setup for anything with multiple panels, in the event where its only 2 panels the collapsable panel goes on the Panel with the input fields.
Also when the user hits search in RemoveTabView, TransferTabView, AdvancedRemoveTabView I want the panel with the inputs on it to collapse to expand the readable area, and when Reset is triggered i want it to expand. (dont use toggling on that as if the panel is already expanded by the user i dont want it to collapse on reset)
Please answer these questions so I can create accurate, comprehensive YAML templates that match your exact requirements!
