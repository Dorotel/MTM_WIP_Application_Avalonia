🔄 Services/Navigation.cs - `INavigationService` - View navigation
🔄 Services/PrintService.cs - `IPrintService` - Printing functionality
🔄 Services/EmergencyKeyboardHook.cs - Low-level keyboard handling

### **FEATURE Services (Keep Separate - 3 services)**  
🟡 Services/QuickButtons.cs - `IQuickButtonsService`, `IProgressService` - Manufacturing feature
🟡 Services/SettingsService.cs - `ISettingsService` - Application settings 
🟡 Services/StartupDialog.cs - Application startup workflow

## 🔗 Service Dependency Chains

### **High-Level Dependencies**
```
Core Services (3) ← Business Services (3) ← UI Services (8)
Core Services (3) ← Infrastructure Services (7) ← Feature Services (3)
```

### **Detailed Dependency Mapping**

#### **Core Dependencies (Foundation)**
- `IDatabaseService` ← Required by QuickButtons, Business Services
- `IConfigurationService` ← Required by Theme, Settings, Print, QuickButtons
- `IApplicationStateService` ← Required by Settings

#### **Infrastructure Dependencies**
- `IFilePathService` ← Required by FileLogging, Print, QuickButtons  
- `INavigationService` ← Required by FileSelection
- `IFocusManagementService` ← Required by SuccessOverlay, SuggestionOverlay

#### **Cross-Service Dependencies**
- `IFileSelectionService` ← Required by QuickButtons
- `IThemeService` ← Required by VirtualPanelManager

### **Circular Dependency Check** ✅
✅ **No circular dependencies detected**  
✅ Dependencies follow proper layered architecture
✅ Core → Infrastructure → UI → Features pattern maintained

## 📋 Consolidation Strategy

### **Proposed Service Groups (Total: 9 services after consolidation)**

#### **1. CoreServices.cs** (Already done - 3 combined)
- Database, Configuration, ErrorHandling  

#### **2. BusinessServices.cs** (Partially done - 3 combined)
- MasterData, Remove, InventoryEditing

#### **3. UIServices.cs** (Consolidate 8 → 1)
- ColumnConfiguration + CustomDataGrid + Overlays + VirtualPanel + Theme + Focus

#### **4. InfrastructureServices.cs** (Consolidate 7 → 1) 
- FileLogging + FileProvider + FilePath + FileSelection + Navigation + Print + KeyboardHook

#### **5. FeatureServices.cs** (Keep 3 separate - Manufacturing specific)
- QuickButtons (with Progress)
- Settings  
- StartupDialog

## ⚠️ Consolidation Risks & Mitigation

### **Identified Risks:**
1. **Large File Size**: UIServices.cs could become >2000 lines
   - *Mitigation*: Use partial classes and #region organization

2. **Interface Coupling**: Multiple interfaces in single file
   - *Mitigation*: Maintain separate interface files, consolidate implementations only

3. **Service Registration Complexity**: Multiple lifetimes in one registration
   - *Mitigation*: Use separate extension methods for each service group

4. **Testing Complexity**: Harder to test consolidated services
   - *Mitigation*: Use interface segregation, mock individual services

### **Breaking Change Prevention:**
✅ **All existing interfaces maintained**  
✅ **Constructor dependencies preserved**
✅ **Service lifetimes unchanged** (Singleton/Scoped/Transient)
✅ **ViewModel injection unchanged**

## 📈 Service Registration Impact

### **Current Registration (18 services):**
```csharp
services.TryAddSingleton<IThemeService, ThemeService>();
services.TryAddSingleton<INavigationService, NavigationService>();
services.TryAddScoped<IFileLoggingService, FileLoggingService>();
// ... 15 more individual registrations
```

### **Proposed Registration (9 services):**
```csharp  
services.AddCoreServices();        // 3 services  
services.AddBusinessServices();    // 3 services
services.AddUIServices();          // 8 → 1 consolidated
services.AddInfrastructureServices(); // 7 → 1 consolidated  
services.AddFeatureServices();     // 3 individual services
```

## 🎯 Next Steps (SubTasks 1.1.2 - 1.1.6)

### **SubTask 1.1.2: Create Core Services Group** ✅ COMPLETE
- Already consolidated: Database + Configuration + ErrorHandling

### **SubTask 1.1.3: Create Business Services Group** 🔄 IN PROGRESS  
- Partially done: MasterData + Remove + InventoryEditing
- Need to validate consolidation and fix any remaining API issues

### **SubTask 1.1.4: Create UI Services Group** 📋 READY
- Consolidate 8 UI services into UIServices.cs
- Priority order: Theme → Focus → Overlays → Panels → DataGrid

### **SubTask 1.1.5: Create Infrastructure Services Group** 📋 READY
- Consolidate 7 infrastructure services into InfrastructureServices.cs  
- Priority order: Navigation → File services → Print → Keyboard

### **SubTask 1.1.6: Update Service Registration** 📋 READY
- Create service extension methods for each group
- Update Program.cs and service discovery
- Validate all ViewModels still resolve dependencies correctly

## 📊 Success Metrics

### **File Reduction:**
- **Before**: 21 service files (3 Core + 18 individual)  
- **After**: 9 service files (4 consolidated groups + 5 individual)
- **Reduction**: 57% fewer service files

### **Maintainability Improvement:**
- Logical service grouping by functionality
- Reduced service registration complexity  
- Cleaner dependency injection patterns
- Better separation of concerns
