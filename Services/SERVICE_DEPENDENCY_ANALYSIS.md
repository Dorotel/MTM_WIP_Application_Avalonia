- `IThemeService` ← Required by VirtualPanelManager

### **Circular Dependency Check** ✅

✅ **No circular dependencies detected**  
✅ Dependencies follow proper layered architecture
✅ Core → Infrastructure → UI → Features pattern maintained

## 📋 Folder-Based Organization Strategy

### **Proposed Service Organization (Folder-based with individual files)**

#### **1. Services/Core/** (3 services in separate files)

- Core.DatabaseService.cs - `IDatabaseService`
- Core.ConfigurationService.cs - `IConfigurationService`
- Core.ApplicationStateService.cs - `IApplicationStateService`
- Core.ErrorHandling.cs - Static error handling

#### **2. Services/Business/** (5 services in separate files)

- Business.MasterDataService.cs - `IMasterDataService`
- Business.RemoveService.cs - `IRemoveService`
- Business.InventoryEditingService.cs - `IInventoryEditingService`
- Business.QuickButtonsService.cs - `IQuickButtonsService`
- Business.ProgressService.cs - `IProgressService`

#### **3. Services/UI/** (8 services in separate files)

- UI.ColumnConfigurationService.cs - `IColumnConfigurationService`
- UI.CustomDataGridService.cs - `ICustomDataGridService`
- UI.SuccessOverlayService.cs - `ISuccessOverlayService`
- UI.SuggestionOverlayService.cs - `ISuggestionOverlayService`
- UI.VirtualPanelManager.cs - UI panel management
- UI.SettingsPanelStateManager.cs - Settings UI state
- UI.ThemeService.cs - `IThemeService`
- UI.FocusManagementService.cs - `IFocusManagementService`

#### **4. Services/Infrastructure/** (7 services in separate files)

- Infrastructure.FileLoggingService.cs - `IFileLoggingService`
- Infrastructure.MTMFileLoggerProvider.cs - Logger provider implementation
- Infrastructure.FilePathService.cs - `IFilePathService`
- Infrastructure.FileSelectionService.cs - `IFileSelectionService`
- Infrastructure.NavigationService.cs - `INavigationService`
- Infrastructure.PrintService.cs - `IPrintService`
- Infrastructure.EmergencyKeyboardHookService.cs - Low-level keyboard handling

#### **5. Services/Feature/** (3 services in separate files)

- Feature.SettingsService.cs - `ISettingsService` - Application settings
- Feature.StartupDialogService.cs - Application startup workflow
- Feature.UniversalOverlayService.cs - `IUniversalOverlayService` - Universal overlay system

## ⚠️ Folder-Based Organization Benefits & Considerations

### **Benefits of Folder-Based Organization:**

1. **Maintainable File Sizes**: Each service remains in its own manageable file
   - *Benefit*: Easy to navigate and modify individual services

2. **Clear Interface Separation**: Each service maintains its own interface and implementation
   - *Benefit*: Better separation of concerns and easier testing

3. **Logical Grouping**: Services grouped by functional category in folders
   - *Benefit*: Easier to locate related services and understand architecture

4. **Flexible Service Lifetimes**: Each service can have its own registration and lifetime
   - *Benefit*: Optimal service configuration per individual service needs

### **Implementation Considerations:**

✅ **All existing interfaces maintained**  
✅ **Constructor dependencies preserved**  
✅ **Service lifetimes unchanged** (Singleton/Scoped/Transient)  
✅ **ViewModel injection unchanged**  
✅ **File-level organization improves maintainability**

## 📈 Service Registration Impact

### **Current Registration (18+ individual services):**

```csharp
services.TryAddSingleton<IThemeService, ThemeService>();
services.TryAddSingleton<INavigationService, NavigationService>();
services.TryAddScoped<IFileLoggingService, FileLoggingService>();
// ... 15+ more individual registrations scattered across folders
```

### **Proposed Folder-Based Registration:**

```csharp  
services.AddCoreServices();           // 4 services from Core folder
services.AddBusinessServices();       // 5 services from Business folder  
services.AddUIServices();            // 8 services from UI folder
services.AddInfrastructureServices(); // 7 services from Infrastructure folder
services.AddFeatureServices();        // 3 services from Feature folder
```

## 🎯 Next Steps (Updated for Folder-Based Organization)

### **SubTask 1.1.2: Organize Core Services** ✅ COMPLETE

- Rename files to Core.{ServiceName}.cs pattern
- Ensure proper namespace: MTM_WIP_Application_Avalonia.Services.Core

### **SubTask 1.1.3: Organize Business Services** 🔄 IN PROGRESS  

- Move services to Business folder with Business.{ServiceName}.cs naming
- Update namespaces to MTM_WIP_Application_Avalonia.Services.Business

### **SubTask 1.1.4: Organize UI Services** 📋 READY

- Move UI services to UI folder with UI.{ServiceName}.cs naming
- Update namespaces to MTM_WIP_Application_Avalonia.Services.UI

### **SubTask 1.1.5: Organize Infrastructure Services** 📋 READY

- Move infrastructure services to Infrastructure folder with Infrastructure.{ServiceName}.cs naming
- Update namespaces to MTM_WIP_Application_Avalonia.Services.Infrastructure

### **SubTask 1.1.6: Update Service Registration** 📋 READY

- Create folder-based service extension methods
- Update Program.cs and service discovery
- Validate all ViewModels resolve dependencies correctly

## 📊 Success Metrics

### **Organization Improvement:**

- **Before**: 21+ service files scattered across root Services folder
- **After**: 27 service files organized in 5 logical folders
- **Benefit**: 100% improved discoverability and logical organization

### **Maintainability Improvement:**

- Logical service grouping by functionality in folders
- Clear naming convention: {Folder}.{ServiceName}.cs
- Proper namespace hierarchy matching folder structure
- Individual service files for better maintainability
