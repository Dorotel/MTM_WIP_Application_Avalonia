# Manufacturer’s Guide to Developing Consumer Product Instructions (Concise)

Purpose: Practical, user-centered guidance to plan, design, and validate consumer product instructions that users notice, understand, and follow.

Note: Summarized from CPSC guidance (Oct 2003) and related standards; adapted and condensed for clarity.

## Using this Guide

Instructions are part of a product system (design, UI, labels, packaging, marketing, training). Treat them as engineered tools, not just writing.

Failure modes:

- Not noticed; not read; skimmed only
- Misunderstood or not remembered
- Not followed due to low credibility, relevance, or high user effort

Lifecycle:

1) Plan (goals, users, constraints)
2) Design (attention → comprehension → motivation)
3) Evaluate (test, revise, retest)

---

## Planning the Instructions

### Define Goals

- Scope: product lifecycle coverage (assembly, use, maintenance, storage, disposal)
- Key tasks: large-scale and fine-grained actions (including learning/recognition tasks)
- Success criteria: measurable outcomes (accuracy, time, comprehension, satisfaction)
- Real-world use: intended uses, foreseeable misuse, risk factors, incident/injury data
- Hazards: identify via FMEA/fault tree, comparable products, CPSC data
- Required knowledge/skills: perform task analysis; identify knowledge gaps

### Know the Audience

- Users: demographics, literacy, abilities, disabilities, familiarity, context, tools
- Attitudes/beliefs: common misconceptions and expectations
- Novices vs experts: write for novices unless a section is intentionally expert-only; label clearly
- Older users: larger type, high contrast, less clutter, memory and dexterity considerations
- Non-English-literate users: consider multilingual instructions and/or well-tested graphics

### Respect Constraints

- Regulations and legal duties (e.g., duty to warn)
- Agency guidance (e.g., CPSC)
- Voluntary standards (e.g., ANSI Z535 series)
- Company standards (format, materials, packaging)

---

## Capturing and Maintaining Attention

### Get Noticed

- Placement: users must encounter instructions at first interaction (attach to product/parts)
- Supplemental directives: hang tags, labels pointing to full instructions; on-product pointers
- Pre-delivery (when feasible): send materials before product arrives; still include with product
- Storage: encourage “Keep these instructions”; provide durable format or product-mounted storage
- Access: provide site/phone for replacements/updates and alternative languages

### Inviting Page Layout

- Page size: pick practical sizes; consider packaging, storage, audience, multi-language needs
- Consistent elements: headers, footers, numbering, headings
- White space: structure and emphasize; avoid clutter
- Graphic elements: boxes/lines/icons sparingly
- Highlighting: bold/size/color/italics with restraint
- Line length: ~35–70 characters; consider multi-column
- Alignment: left-justified, ragged right
- Graphic proximity: place graphics near referenced text; orient naturally

### Inviting Text and Graphics

- Legible typefaces (e.g., Times New Roman, Arial); adequate text size (≈12pt; larger for elders/distance)
- Mixed case for readability; dark text on light background for body text
- Procedures: numbered steps (one action per step)
- Lists: use bullets for non-sequential items
- Graphics: simple, high-contrast line drawings; avoid fine detail reliance

---

## Securing Comprehension

### Helpful Structure

- Split into multiple documents if audiences/tasks/timing differ (e.g., assembly vs use)
- Organize by user tasks/goals, not product features; stage complex flows into sub-sequences
- Number pages; include table of contents for longer docs
- Headings: short, meaningful, consistent per level (question/statement/topic style)
- Brief overview and labeled product diagram near start; include parts list where helpful
- Consistent naming; prefer common words over technical codes
- Repeat time-critical/task-critical info where needed; minimize cross-references
- Index/glossary only when beneficial (keep language simple to avoid glossary dependency)

### Readable Text

- Reading level: target ~6th–8th grade for general audiences
- Sentences: concise (avg 15–25 words), one main idea; limit subordinate clauses
- Voice: active > passive
- Avoid noun strings and multiple negatives
- Use everyday, concrete, specific words; define unavoidable jargon/acronyms on first use
- Consistent terminology; use personal pronouns and gender-neutral language

### Effective Graphics

- Prefer line drawings; show user’s point of view; label parts by name
- Use widely understood symbols; test non-standard symbols
- Flow charts for complex/nonlinear troubleshooting if audience can interpret them
- Graphs/tables for trends/comparisons if audience is comfortable with them

---

## Motivating Compliance

### Credibility

- Consistent messages across packaging, advertising, labels, and manuals
- Avoid platitudes/“throwaway” statements; don’t dilute critical warnings
- Explain demands that may seem excessive (rationale matters)
- Prioritize/organize information to show intent to communicate, not deflect liability
- Cite credible authorities appropriately; maintain ownership of the message
- Professional quality: materials, translations, visuals, tone

### Relevance and Costs

- Minimize user effort to use the document; streamline navigation; reduce flipping
- Efficient task sequencing; include tools/job aids; provide support contacts
- Address user beliefs; show why instructions matter (benefits, pitfalls, time/money savers)
- State positive, specific actions (“Wear rubber gloves” vs “Avoid skin contact”)
- Emphasize benefits and real consequences; provide progress feedback

### Memory and Recall

- Use highlighting and supportive graphics
- Chunk information into small, meaningful groups
- Provide concise summaries (quick-start/troubleshooting/maintenance cards)
- On-product reminders for critical or recurring tasks
- Consider dynamic media (video/web); include training/practice where appropriate

---

## Presenting Safety Information

### What Safety Messages Are Needed

- Identify hazards not eliminated or guarded by design
- Repeat all on-product labels in the manual; avoid over-warning by prioritizing

### What to Say

- Use signal words per ANSI Z535.4 (DANGER, WARNING, CAUTION) correctly
- State: hazard, consequences, and avoidance behavior (explicit, concrete, doable)
- Sequence is flexible; front-load avoidance when readers may not finish

### Where to Place

- Separate safety from non-safety tips
- Universal safety: early in document; section-level safety: at section start
- Step-specific safety: embed immediately before/within the step
- Consider a concise “Key Safety Warnings” list early; still repeat locally
- Group long warning lists into meaningful categories

### How It Should Look

- Use a distinct, consistent safety format to signal importance
- Consider ANSI label elements: safety alert symbol, signal word panel, message, optional pictorial, border
- Use consistent highlighting (size, bold, color/shading) distinct from non-safety notes
- Use supportive graphics; test comprehension; avoid critical confusions

---

## Evaluating the Instructions

### What to Consider

- Verify technical accuracy (expert review)
- Use human factors/usability experts for formal tests
- Recruit representative users (include critical subgroups)
- Test with the actual product and realistic settings
- Assess attention, comprehension, acceptance, memory, errors, compliance
- Revise and retest iteratively

### Methods (Choose by goal)

- Readability formulas (Flesch-Kincaid, SMOG, Dale-Chall): screen text difficulty
- Comprehension tests: open-ended preferred; clear scoring; include subgroups
- Usability testing: observe tasks, times, errors; think-aloud; structured conditions
- Focus groups/interviews: qualitative insights on perceptions, beliefs, strategies
- Surveys: quantitative measures (sample carefully; pilot items)
- Log diaries: long-term, real-world use/misuse/incidents
- Observation: unobtrusive naturalistic/staged-context behavior
- Memory recall: delayed tests with realistic cues; distinguish recall vs recognition
- Archival data: incidents, complaints, support calls; use for updates
