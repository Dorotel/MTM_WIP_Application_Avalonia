## üìù **Core Template Categories**

### **1. Inventory Management Templates**

#### **Template: Add Inventory Item**
```gherkin
Feature: Add Inventory Item
  As a manufacturing operator
  I want to add inventory items to the system
  So that I can track parts and materials accurately

Background:
  Given the MTM WIP Application is running
  And I am logged in as a manufacturing operator
  And the database connection is active
  And master data is available

Scenario: Successfully add inventory item with valid data
  Given I navigate to the Inventory Tab
  When I enter the following inventory details:
    | Field     | Value      |
    | Part ID   | PART001    |
    | Quantity  | 100        |
    | Location  | WH-A-001   |
    | Operation | 100        |
  And I click the "Save" button
  Then the system should process the inventory addition
  And I should see a success confirmation message
  And the new inventory item should appear in the search results
  And a transaction record should be created with type "IN"
  And the database should reflect the quantity increase

Scenario: Validate required field validation
  Given I navigate to the Inventory Tab
  When I attempt to save without entering required fields:
    | Missing Field | Expected Validation Message |
    | Part ID       | Part ID is required         |
    | Quantity      | Quantity must be greater than 0 |
    | Location      | Location selection is required |
    | Operation     | Operation selection is required |
  Then I should see appropriate validation messages
  And the save operation should be prevented
  And no database changes should occur

Scenario: Handle duplicate inventory addition
  Given inventory item "PART001" already exists at location "WH-A-001" operation "100"
  When I attempt to add the same part with:
    | Part ID   | PART001  |
    | Location  | WH-A-001 |
    | Operation | 100      |
    | Quantity  | 50       |
  Then the system should add the quantity to the existing item
  And the total quantity should be the sum of existing and new quantities
  And a single transaction record should be created

Scenario: Validate manufacturing data format
  Given I navigate to the Inventory Tab
  When I enter invalid data formats:
    | Field     | Invalid Value | Expected Behavior |
    | Part ID   | part001       | Must be uppercase |
    | Part ID   | PART          | Must include numbers |
    | Quantity  | -5            | Must be positive |
    | Quantity  | 0             | Must be greater than 0 |
  Then I should see format validation errors
  And the save operation should be prevented

Performance Acceptance Criteria:
  - Inventory addition must complete within 2 seconds
  - Database transaction must be atomic (all-or-nothing)
  - System must handle concurrent additions without data corruption
  - UI must remain responsive during processing

Error Handling Acceptance Criteria:
  - Database connection failures must show user-friendly error messages
  - Validation errors must be displayed immediately with clear guidance
  - System must log all errors for troubleshooting
  - Failed operations must not leave partial data in the database

Security Acceptance Criteria:
  - Only authorized users can add inventory
  - All inventory additions must be logged with user identification
  - Sensitive operations must require confirmation
  - System must validate user permissions before processing
```

#### **Template: Transfer Inventory**
```gherkin
Feature: Transfer Inventory Between Locations
  As a manufacturing operator
  I want to transfer inventory between locations and operations
  So that I can support production workflow requirements

Background:
  Given the MTM WIP Application is running
  And I am logged in with transfer permissions
  And inventory items are available for transfer

Scenario: Successfully transfer inventory between locations
  Given part "PART002" has quantity 200 at location "WH-A-001" operation "100"
  When I initiate a transfer with:
    | From Location | WH-A-001 |
    | To Location   | WH-B-001 |
    | Part ID       | PART002  |
    | Operation     | 100      |
    | Quantity      | 75       |
  And I confirm the transfer
  Then the system should process the transfer successfully
  And part "PART002" should have quantity 125 at "WH-A-001"
  And part "PART002" should have quantity 75 at "WH-B-001"
  And two transaction records should be created:
    | Location  | Type     | Quantity |
    | WH-A-001  | OUT      | 75       |
    | WH-B-001  | IN       | 75       |

Scenario: Prevent transfer of insufficient inventory
  Given part "PART003" has quantity 50 at location "WH-A-001"
  When I attempt to transfer 75 units
  Then the system should prevent the transfer
  And I should see an insufficient inventory error message
  And no database changes should occur
  And the user should be informed of available quantity

Scenario: Transfer between operations (production flow)
  Given part "PART004" has quantity 100 at operation "90"
  When I transfer 80 units from operation "90" to operation "100"
  Then the system should update both operation inventories
  And production workflow tracking should be maintained
