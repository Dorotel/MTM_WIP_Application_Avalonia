        # ðŸš§ TransferTabView Implementation Gap Report
        
        This report summarizes all work that is still not done or is not done correctly for the TransferTabView feature, based on the comprehensive specification and current build status.
        
        ## CRITICAL BLOCKERS
   - Dual-panel layout, DataGrid-centric display, and CollapsiblePanel integration are not present in TransferTabView.axaml
   - CollapsiblePanel.axaml: The header is currently positioned on the left side; it must be moved to the top for TransferTabView and all InventoryTabView-based layouts to match the specification and user expectations.
   - ComboBoxes have not been replaced with TextBoxes + SuggestionOverlay (no ComboBoxes found, but TextBoxes/SuggestionOverlay missing)
   - NumericUpDown control for quantity transfer is not implemented
   - InventoryTabView styling and mandatory grid pattern are not applied
   - SuggestionOverlay, QuickButtons, SuccessOverlay, and progress reporting integrations are missing
   - Validation, error handling, accessibility, and keyboard shortcuts are not implemented
   - Batch transfer, atomic transaction handling, and audit trail logic are incomplete
        
        ## Detailed Outstanding Work

        1. **UI Implementation**
           - Implement dual-panel layout and DataGrid-centric display in TransferTabView.axaml
           - Position transfer configuration fields above DataGrid
           - Integrate CollapsiblePanel with auto-collapse/expand behavior for input area
           - Replace all ComboBoxes with TextBoxes + SuggestionOverlay (ComboBoxes not present, but SuggestionOverlay/TextBoxes missing)
           - Add NumericUpDown control for quantity transfer
           - Apply InventoryTabView styling and grid pattern for consistency
           - Update CollapsiblePanel.axaml so the header is positioned on top, not on the left side, for TransferTabView and all InventoryTabView-based layouts.
        2. **Input Field Implementation**
           - Use SuggestionOverlay for Part ID, Operation, To Location fields
           - Apply TextBoxFuzzyValidationBehavior and watermark text
           - Add real-time validation feedback for all inputs
        3. **Quantity Management**
           - Implement NumericUpDown with increment/decrement, max limit, and keyboard support
           - Provide visual feedback for invalid quantities
           - Support partial and complete item transfers
        4. **DataGrid Functionality**
           - Enable single/multi-row selection, sortable columns, and row highlighting
           - Add "Nothing Found" indicator and loading state
           - Display available quantity for planning
        5. **Transfer Operations & Business Logic**
           - Enforce "TRANSFER" transaction type for all transfers
           - Treat operation numbers as workflow steps only
           - Implement batch transfer, atomic transaction handling, and audit trail
           - Apply yellow color coding in QuickButtons history
        6. **Panel Behavior & Keyboard Shortcuts**
           - Implement auto-collapse/expand for Search/Reset panel
           - Add smooth animations and visual indicators
           - Support F5, Enter, Escape, Tab, Arrow keys for navigation and actions
        7. **Overlay & Integration Points**
           - Integrate SuggestionOverlay, QuickButtons, SuccessOverlay, MainView status bar, CollapsiblePanel, ErrorHandling, and MTM Theme system
        8. **Validation & Error Handling**
           - Enforce destination, quantity, Part ID, and Operation validation
           - Add real-time feedback and pre-transfer validation
           - Integrate centralized ErrorHandling service
        9. **Accessibility**
           - Add ToolTip.Tip, focus management, screen reader support, keyboard navigation, high contrast compatibility, and logical tab order
        10. **Testing & Performance**
           - Add integration tests and optimize for large datasets and real-time validation
        
        ---

   **Immediate next step:**
   Implement TransferTabView.axaml with dual-panel layout, DataGrid-centric display, CollapsiblePanel, NumericUpDown for quantity, SuggestionOverlay for all input fields, and integrate overlays, QuickButtons, SuccessOverlay, and progress reporting. Enforce business logic, validation, accessibility, and keyboard shortcuts as described in the specification.
