# 🎨 Implement Advanced MTM Theming System Based on User Configuration

## 📋 Issue Summary
Implement a comprehensive theming system for the MTM WIP Application based on user questionnaire results that selected the most advanced options across all theming categories. This includes user-selectable theme library, smart adaptive theming, instant live switching, custom accessibility builder, adaptive performance, contextual smart coloring, and full ecosystem integration.

## 📊 Configuration Requirements
Based on the completed theming questionnaire CSV results:

- [ ] Update MainView and other views for theme support
- [ ] Implement theme resource management in Avalonia

### **Database Integration**
- [ ] Create stored procedures for theme preference storage (optional)
- [ ] Use existing `Helper_Database_StoredProcedure` patterns
- [ ] Follow MTM database access conventions
- [ ] Support both local and database preference storage

## 🔧 Development Guidelines

### **Follow MTM Patterns**
- Use standard .NET patterns (no ReactiveUI)
- Implement INotifyPropertyChanged for ViewModels
- Use AsyncCommand/RelayCommand for commands
- Follow established error handling via ErrorHandling service
- Use dependency injection throughout

### **Performance Considerations**
- Implement smart caching for theme resources
- Use progressive loading for complex themes
- Optimize for older factory computers (adaptive performance)
- Minimize resource usage during theme switching

### **Accessibility Standards**
- Follow WCAG AA guidelines
- Support Windows High Contrast mode
- Provide colorblind-friendly alternatives
- Include keyboard navigation support
- Support screen reader compatibility

### **Testing Requirements**
- Unit tests for theme service logic
- Integration tests for theme switching
- UI tests for theme selection interface
- Performance tests for theme loading
- Accessibility testing for all themes
