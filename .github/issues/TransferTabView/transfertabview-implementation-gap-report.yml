        # ðŸš§ TransferTabView Implementation Gap Report
        
        This report summarizes all work that is still not done or is not done correctly for the TransferTabView feature, based on the comprehensive specification and current build status.
        
        ## CRITICAL BLOCKERS
        - Dual-panel layout, DataGrid-centric display, and CollapsiblePanel integration are incomplete
        - ComboBoxes not replaced with TextBoxes + SuggestionOverlay
        - NumericUpDown control for quantity transfer is missing
        - InventoryTabView styling and mandatory grid pattern not fully applied
        - SuggestionOverlay, QuickButtons, SuccessOverlay, and progress reporting integrations are missing
        - Validation, error handling, accessibility, and keyboard shortcuts are not implemented
        - Batch transfer, atomic transaction handling, and audit trail logic are incomplete
        
        ## Detailed Outstanding Work

        3. **Quantity Management**

           - Visual feedback for invalid quantities
           - Support partial and complete item transfers
        4. **DataGrid Functionality**

           - Add "Nothing Found" indicator and loading state
           - Display available quantity for planning
        5. **Transfer Operations & Business Logic**
           - Enforce "TRANSFER" transaction type for all transfers
           - Treat operation numbers as workflow steps only

        **Immediate next step:**
        Complete the dual-panel layout, integrate all overlays and controls, and enforce business logic and validation as described in the specification.
