        # ðŸš§ RemoveTabView Implementation Gap Report
        
        This report summarizes all work that is still not done or is not done correctly for the RemoveTabView feature, based on the comprehensive specification and current build status.
        
        ## CRITICAL BLOCKERS
        - DataGrid-centric layout and CollapsiblePanel integration are incomplete
        - ComboBoxes not replaced with TextBoxes + SuggestionOverlay
        - Search/Reset button functionality and auto-collapse/expand behavior are missing
        - QuickButtons, SuccessOverlay, and progress reporting integrations are not implemented
        - Batch/multi-row deletion, atomic transaction handling, and audit trail logic are incomplete
        - Validation, error handling, accessibility, and keyboard shortcuts are not fully implemented
        
        ## Detailed Outstanding Work
        
        1. **UI Implementation**
           - Complete DataGrid-centric layout and position search/filter inputs above DataGrid
           - Integrate CollapsiblePanel with auto-collapse/expand behavior
           - Replace ComboBoxes with TextBoxes + SuggestionOverlay
           - Apply InventoryTabView styling and grid pattern
        2. **Input Field Implementation**
           - Use SuggestionOverlay for Part ID, Operation, Location, and User fields (where applicable)
           - Apply TextBoxFuzzyValidationBehavior and watermark text
           - Add consistent styling and real-time validation feedback
        3. **DataGrid Functionality**
           - Enable multi-row selection, sortable columns, and row highlighting
           - Add "Nothing Found" indicator and loading state
           - Support context menu for row-level operations (optional)
        4. **Batch Operations**
           - Implement batch delete button, confirmation dialog, and progress indication
           - Ensure atomic transaction handling and individual row validation
           - Provide detailed operation results reporting
        5. **Panel Behavior & Keyboard Shortcuts**
           - Implement auto-collapse/expand for Search/Reset
           - Add smooth animations and visual indicators
           - Support F5, Delete, Ctrl+Z, Escape, Enter, Tab navigation
        6. **Overlay & Integration Points**
           - Integrate QuickButtons, SuccessOverlay, MainView status bar, CollapsiblePanel, ErrorHandling, and MTM Theme system
        7. **Validation & Error Handling**
           - Enforce destination, quantity, Part ID, Operation, and User validation
           - Add real-time feedback and pre-delete validation
           - Integrate centralized ErrorHandling service
        8. **Accessibility**
           - Add ToolTip.Tip, focus management, screen reader support, keyboard navigation, high contrast compatibility, and logical tab order
        9. **Testing & Performance**
           - Add integration tests and optimize for large datasets and batch operations
        
        ---
        
        **Immediate next step:**
        Complete the DataGrid-centric layout, integrate all overlays and controls, and enforce business logic and validation as described in the specification.
