        # ðŸš§ RemoveTabView Implementation Gap Report
        
        This report summarizes all work that is still not done or is not done correctly for the RemoveTabView feature, based on the comprehensive specification and current build status.
        

        ## CRITICAL BLOCKERS (Current Build Validation)
        - RemoveTabView.axaml: No DataGrid implementation, ComboBoxes not replaced with TextBoxes + SuggestionOverlay, CollapsiblePanel integration missing, Search/Reset button functionality absent, QuickButtons and SuccessOverlay not integrated, progress reporting not present.
        - RemoveItemViewModel.cs: Business logic is present, but not connected to new UI components. No batch/multi-row deletion, atomic transaction handling, or audit trail logic in UI. Validation, error handling, accessibility, and keyboard shortcuts are not fully implemented in the view.
        - Integration Points: No evidence of overlay, progress, or theme system integration in UI. Accessibility features and keyboard navigation not present.
        - Testing & Performance: No integration tests or performance optimizations for large datasets and batch operations.

        ## What Still Needs to Be Fixed

        1. **UI Implementation**
           - Implement DataGrid-centric layout with search/filter inputs above DataGrid.
           - Integrate CollapsiblePanel with auto-collapse/expand behavior for input area.
           - Replace all ComboBoxes with TextBoxes + SuggestionOverlay.
           - Apply InventoryTabView styling and grid pattern for consistency.

        2. **Input Field Implementation**
           - Use SuggestionOverlay for Part ID, Operation, Location, and User fields.
           - Apply TextBoxFuzzyValidationBehavior and watermark text.
           - Add consistent styling and real-time validation feedback.

        3. **DataGrid Functionality**
           - Enable multi-row selection, sortable columns, and row highlighting.
           - Add "Nothing Found" indicator and loading state.
           - Support context menu for row-level operations (optional).

        4. **Batch Operations**
           - Implement batch delete button, confirmation dialog, and progress indication.
           - Ensure atomic transaction handling and individual row validation.
           - Provide detailed operation results reporting.

        5. **Panel Behavior & Keyboard Shortcuts**
           - Implement auto-collapse/expand for Search/Reset.
           - Add smooth animations and visual indicators.
           - Support F5, Delete, Ctrl+Z, Escape, Enter, Tab navigation.

        6. **Overlay & Integration Points**
           - Integrate QuickButtons, SuccessOverlay, MainView status bar, CollapsiblePanel, ErrorHandling, and MTM Theme system.

        7. **Validation & Error Handling**
           - Enforce destination, quantity, Part ID, Operation, and User validation.
           - Add real-time feedback and pre-delete validation.
           - Integrate centralized ErrorHandling service.

        8. **Accessibility**
           - Add ToolTip.Tip, focus management, screen reader support, keyboard navigation, high contrast compatibility, and logical tab order.

        9. **Testing & Performance**
           - Add integration tests and optimize for large datasets and batch operations.

        ## Acceptance Criteria
        - RemoveTabView.axaml fully implemented with DataGrid-centric layout, SuggestionOverlay, CollapsiblePanel, QuickButtons, SuccessOverlay, and progress reporting integrations. All business logic, validation, accessibility, and keyboard shortcuts requirements met.

        ---

        **Immediate next step:**
        Implement DataGrid-centric layout, connect all overlays and controls, and enforce business logic, validation, and accessibility as described in the specification.
