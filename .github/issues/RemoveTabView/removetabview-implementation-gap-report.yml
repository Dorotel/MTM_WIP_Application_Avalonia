        # ðŸš§ RemoveTabView Implementation Gap Report
        
        This report summarizes all work that is still not done or is not done correctly for the RemoveTabView feature, based on the comprehensive specification and current build status.
        

        ## CRITICAL BLOCKERS (Current Build Validation)
   - RemoveTabView.axaml: PR #60 introduces DataGrid implementation, CollapsiblePanel integration, and InventoryTabView styling. ComboBoxes have been replaced with TextBoxes + SuggestionOverlay. Search/Reset button functionality, QuickButtons, SuccessOverlay, and progress reporting are present but require further validation and refinement.
   - CollapsiblePanel.axaml: The header is currently positioned on the left side; it must be moved to the top for RemoveTabView and all InventoryTabView-based layouts to match the specification and user expectations.
   - RemoveItemViewModel.cs: Business logic is connected to new UI components. Batch/multi-row deletion, atomic transaction handling, and audit trail logic are implemented, but validation, error handling, accessibility, and keyboard shortcuts need further review and testing.
   - Integration Points: Overlay, progress, and theme system integration are present. Accessibility features and keyboard navigation are partially implemented and require completion.
   - Testing & Performance: Some integration tests and performance optimizations for large datasets and batch operations are present, but coverage is incomplete.

        ## What Still Needs to Be Fixed

   1. **UI Implementation**
      - Validate DataGrid-centric layout with search/filter inputs above DataGrid.
      - Refine CollapsiblePanel auto-collapse/expand behavior for input area.
      - Confirm all ComboBoxes are replaced with TextBoxes + SuggestionOverlay.
      - Ensure InventoryTabView styling and grid pattern are fully consistent.
      - Update CollapsiblePanel.axaml so the header is positioned on top, not on the left side, for RemoveTabView and all InventoryTabView-based layouts.

        2. **Input Field Implementation**
           - Validate SuggestionOverlay for Part ID, Operation, Location, and User fields.
           - Confirm TextBoxFuzzyValidationBehavior and watermark text are present.
           - Refine styling and real-time validation feedback for all inputs.

        3. **DataGrid Functionality**
           - Confirm multi-row selection, sortable columns, and row highlighting are enabled.
           - Validate "Nothing Found" indicator and loading state.
           - Add/validate context menu for row-level operations (optional).

        4. **Batch Operations**
           - Refine batch delete button, confirmation dialog, and progress indication.
           - Validate atomic transaction handling and individual row validation.
           - Confirm detailed operation results reporting.

        5. **Panel Behavior & Keyboard Shortcuts**
           - Refine auto-collapse/expand for Search/Reset.
           - Validate smooth animations and visual indicators.
           - Confirm support for F5, Delete, Ctrl+Z, Escape, Enter, Tab navigation.

        6. **Overlay & Integration Points**
           - Validate QuickButtons, SuccessOverlay, MainView status bar, CollapsiblePanel, ErrorHandling, and MTM Theme system integration.

        7. **Validation & Error Handling**
           - Refine destination, quantity, Part ID, Operation, and User validation.
           - Validate real-time feedback and pre-delete validation.
           - Confirm centralized ErrorHandling service integration.

        8. **Accessibility**
           - Refine ToolTip.Tip, focus management, screen reader support, keyboard navigation, high contrast compatibility, and logical tab order.

        9. **Testing & Performance**
           - Add/complete integration tests and optimize for large datasets and batch operations.

        ## Acceptance Criteria
   - RemoveTabView.axaml implemented with DataGrid-centric layout, SuggestionOverlay, CollapsiblePanel, QuickButtons, SuccessOverlay, and progress reporting integrations. Business logic, validation, accessibility, and keyboard shortcuts requirements are partially met; further refinement and testing required for full acceptance.

        ---

   **Immediate next step:**
   Refine DataGrid-centric layout, overlays, controls, and enforce business logic, validation, accessibility, and keyboard shortcuts. Complete integration and add comprehensive tests as described in the specification.
