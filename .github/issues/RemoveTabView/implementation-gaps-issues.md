**Priority**: Critical (blocks core functionality)

### **Current State**
- [x] QuickButtons integration logic exists in RemoveTabView.axaml.cs
- [x] PopulateFromQuickButton method implemented in RemoveItemViewModel
- [ ] FindQuickButtonsView() method sometimes returns null
- [ ] Visual tree walking fails in complex layout scenarios
- [ ] No fallback strategy for service resolution

### **Required Implementation**
- [ ] Improve visual tree walking with proper error handling
- [ ] Add service locator fallback when visual tree fails
- [ ] Ensure 100% reliable field population from QuickButtons
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging for debugging integration issues

### **Acceptance Criteria**
- [ ] QuickButtons field population works 100% of the time
- [ ] History logging functional for all removal operations
- [ ] No null reference exceptions in FindQuickButtonsView()
- [ ] Fallback service resolution working correctly
- [ ] Integration tested across all MTM themes

### **Files to Modify**
- `Views/MainForm/Panels/RemoveTabView.axaml.cs` - Lines 625-680 (FindQuickButtonsView methods)
- `ViewModels/MainForm/RemoveItemViewModel.cs` - Lines 750-780 (PopulateFromQuickButton method)

### **Implementation Hints**
```csharp
private QuickButtonsView? FindQuickButtonsView()
{
    try 
    {
        // Current visual tree walking
        var found = WalkVisualTreeForQuickButtons();
        if (found != null) return found;
        
        // FALLBACK: Use service locator
        var quickButtonsService = _serviceProvider?.GetService<IQuickButtonsService>();
        if (quickButtonsService?.GetView() is QuickButtonsView serviceView)
        {
            _logger?.LogInformation("QuickButtonsView resolved via service locator fallback");
            return serviceView;
        }
        
        _logger?.LogWarning("QuickButtonsView not found via visual tree or service locator");
        return null;
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        _logger?.LogError(ex, "Error finding QuickButtonsView");
        return null;
    }
}
```

        var successfulRestorations = new List<InventoryItem>();
        
        // Start transaction for atomic restoration
        using var transaction = await _databaseService.BeginTransactionAsync();
        
        foreach (var item in _lastRemovedItems)
        {
            var result = await _databaseService.RestoreInventoryItemAsync(
                item.PartID,
                item.Location, 
                item.Operation ?? string.Empty,
                item.Quantity,
                item.ItemType,
                _applicationState.CurrentUser,

                throw new InvalidOperationException($"Failed to restore {item.PartID}: {result.Message}");
            }
        }
        
        await transaction.CommitAsync();
        
        // Update UI only after successful database restoration
        foreach (var item in successfulRestorations)
        {
            InventoryItems.Add(item);
        }
        
        _lastRemovedItems.Clear();

        // If command starts loading, wait for it to complete
        if (_viewModel != null)
        {
            var timeout = DateTime.Now.AddSeconds(10); // Timeout safety
            while (_viewModel.IsLoading && DateTime.Now < timeout)
            {
                await Task.Delay(100);
            }
            
            // Additional delay for user to see results
            await Task.Delay(200);
        }
        
        // Auto-collapse only if search was successful and panel should collapse
        if (_searchPanel != null && !(_viewModel?.IsLoading ?? true))
        {
            _searchPanel.IsExpanded = false;
            _logger?.LogDebug("Search completed - panel auto-collapsed after delay");
        }
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        _logger?.LogError(ex, "Error in search button auto-behavior");
    }
}

private async void OnResetButtonClick(object? sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    try
    {
        // Wait for reset to complete
