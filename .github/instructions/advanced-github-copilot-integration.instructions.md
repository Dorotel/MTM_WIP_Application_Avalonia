### Manufacturing Domain Code Generation Prompts

#### Complex ViewModel Creation with Manufacturing Context
```
Generate a complete MVVM Community Toolkit ViewModel for manufacturing inventory transaction processing with:

- RelayCommand for SaveTransactionAsync with proper error handling using ErrorHandling.HandleErrorAsync
- Validation logic ensuring TransactionType is determined by user intent (IN/OUT/TRANSFER)
- Manufacturing business rules: no negative inventory, operation sequence validation
- Integration with IInventoryService and ITransactionService
- QuickButton creation from successful transactions
- Cross-platform compatibility considerations
Use MTM manufacturing context with part numbers like "MOTOR_HOUSING_001", operations "90","100","110","120", locations "STATION_A"
```
