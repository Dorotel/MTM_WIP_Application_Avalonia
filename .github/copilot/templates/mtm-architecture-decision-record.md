## Technology Implications

### MTM Technology Stack Impact

#### .NET 8 and C# 12 Implications
```csharp
// Example code showing how the decision impacts .NET implementation
[ObservableObject]
public partial class [ComponentName]ViewModel : BaseViewModel
{
    // Implementation pattern affected by this decision
    [ObservableProperty]
    private [DataType] property = default!;
    
    [RelayCommand]
    private async Task ExecuteActionAsync()
    {
        // Decision-specific implementation
    }
}
```

#### Avalonia UI 11.3.4 Implications
```xml
<!-- AXAML changes required by this decision -->

```csharp
// Service pattern changes
public class [Service]Service : I[Service]Service
{
    public async Task<ServiceResult<T>> ProcessAsync([DataType] data)
    {
        // Decision-specific service implementation
        var parameters = new MySqlParameter[]
        {
            new("p_Param1", data.Value1),
            new("p_Param2", data.Value2)
        };
        
        var result = await Helper_Database_StoredProcedure.ExecuteDataTableWithStatus(
            connectionString, "[stored_procedure]", parameters);
            
        // Process result according to decision
        return result.Status == 1
