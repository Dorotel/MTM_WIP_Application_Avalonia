# MTM Manufacturing Business Domain Context

## üè≠ Manufacturing Domain Knowledge

### **Core Business Concepts**

#### **Inventory Management System**
The MTM WIP Application manages Work-In-Progress (WIP) inventory for manufacturing operations:

- **Parts**: Physical components identified by unique PartIDs
- **Operations**: Workflow steps (represented as numbers: "90", "100", "110", "120")
- **Locations**: Physical storage areas in manufacturing facility
- **Batches**: Groups of identical parts processed together
- **Transactions**: Movement records (IN/OUT/TRANSFER)

#### **Transaction Types and Business Logic**
```
Transaction Type Determination (CRITICAL):
- IN: User is ADDING inventory to system
- OUT: User is REMOVING inventory from system  
- TRANSFER: User is MOVING inventory between locations

Operations are workflow steps, NOT transaction indicators:
- Operation "90" ‚â† IN transaction
- Operation "100" ‚â† OUT transaction
- Transaction type determined by USER INTENT, not operation number
```

### **Business Rules**

#### **Inventory Rules**
- Every inventory item must have: PartID, Location, Operation, Quantity
- Quantities are always positive integers (no decimals in manufacturing)
- Batch numbers track individual groups through manufacturing process
- Items can only exist in one location at a time per operation

#### **Operation Workflow**
- Operations represent stages in manufacturing process
- Common operations: "90" (Raw Materials), "100" (In Process), "110" (Quality Check), "120" (Finished)
- Parts move through operations sequentially in manufacturing workflow
- Each operation may have different locations and requirements

#### **User Permissions**
- Regular users: Can view and perform basic inventory operations
- Supervisors: Can modify and approve transactions
- Administrators: Can manage master data (parts, locations, operations)

### **Manufacturing Scenarios**

#### **Receiving Materials (IN Transaction)**
User receives raw materials into inventory:
```
Business Intent: Add inventory
Transaction Type: IN
Example: Receive 100 units of PART001 at operation "90" in location "RECEIVING"
```

#### **Consuming Materials (OUT Transaction)**  
User removes inventory for production use:
```
Business Intent: Remove inventory
Transaction Type: OUT
Example: Issue 50 units of PART001 from operation "90" to production floor
```

#### **Moving Between Locations (TRANSFER Transaction)**
User moves inventory without changing operation:
```
Business Intent: Move inventory
Transaction Type: TRANSFER
Example: Move 25 units of PART001 from "RECEIVING" to "STORAGE" at same operation "90"
```

#### **Advancing Through Operations**
User moves parts to next manufacturing stage:
```
Business Intent: Workflow progression
Transaction Type: Combination of OUT (from current operation) + IN (to next operation)
Example: Move PART001 from operation "90" to operation "100"
```

### **Data Relationships**

#### **Master Data Dependencies**
```
Parts (md_part_ids)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ItemNumber (primary identifier)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Customer (who ordered the part)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Description (what the part is)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ItemType (classification)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ IssuedBy (who created the part record)

Locations (md_locations)  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Location (primary identifier)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Building (physical building)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ IssuedBy (who created location)

Operations (md_operation_numbers)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Operation (primary identifier, usually numeric string)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ IssuedBy (who created operation)

ItemTypes (md_item_types)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ItemType (primary identifier)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ IssuedBy (who created type)
```

#### **Transaction Logging**
Every inventory change creates transaction record:
```
Transaction Log (inv_transaction)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TransactionType (IN/OUT/TRANSFER)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PartID (what part)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BatchNumber (which batch)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ FromLocation (source location, null for IN)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ToLocation (destination location)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Operation (workflow stage)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Quantity (how many)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ User (who performed action)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Timestamp (when performed)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Notes (additional context)
```

### **Common Business Workflows**

#### **Daily Manufacturing Flow**
1. **Morning Setup**: Check inventory levels for daily production
2. **Material Issue**: Issue raw materials to production (OUT transactions)
3. **Work-in-Progress**: Track parts moving through operations
4. **Quality Control**: Verify parts at inspection operations
5. **Finished Goods**: Receive completed parts into finished inventory (IN transactions)
6. **Shipping**: Issue finished goods to customers (OUT transactions)

#### **Inventory Reconciliation**
1. **Physical Count**: Count actual inventory in locations
2. **System Comparison**: Compare physical count to system records
3. **Adjustment**: Create adjustment transactions for discrepancies
4. **Approval**: Supervisor approval for adjustments above threshold

#### **Parts Tracking**
1. **Receipt**: Parts received with batch numbers
2. **Lot Tracking**: Batch numbers maintained through all operations
3. **Traceability**: Ability to track parts from raw material to finished goods
4. **Quality Issues**: Isolate and track defective batches

### **Error Scenarios and Handling**

#### **Common Business Errors**
- **Insufficient Inventory**: User tries to remove more than available
- **Invalid Location**: User specifies location that doesn't exist
- **Wrong Operation**: User tries to skip operations in workflow
- **Duplicate Batch**: User tries to create duplicate batch number

#### **Business Validation Rules**
- Quantity must be positive
- Location must exist in master data
- Operation must exist in master data
- Part must exist in master data
- User must have permission for operation type

### **Integration Points**

#### **External Systems**
- **ERP System**: Master data synchronization
- **Quality System**: Defect tracking and batch holds
- **Shipping System**: Order fulfillment and logistics
- **Production Planning**: Demand forecasting and scheduling

#### **Reporting Requirements**
- **Inventory Levels**: Current stock by part/location/operation
- **Transaction History**: All movements for audit trail
- **Performance Metrics**: Inventory accuracy, throughput rates
- **Exception Reports**: Negative inventory, aged stock, discrepancies
