## MTM-Specific Workflow Patterns

### UI Generation from Markdown Files
When working with markdown instruction files that describe UI components:

1. **Parse Component Hierarchy** - Extract the tree structure and convert to Avalonia AXAML
2. **Map MTM Data Types** - Use Part ID (string), Operation (string numbers), Quantity (integer)
3. **Apply Context Menu Patterns** - Add management features via right-click menus
4. **Implement Space Optimization** - Use UniformGrid and proper alignment for component removal
5. **Follow MTM Color Scheme** - Apply purple brand colors consistently
6. **Create ReactiveUI Bindings** - Generate ViewModels with proper observable patterns

### Quality Assurance Workflow
For comprehensive code compliance verification:

1. **Initial Assessment** - Review code files against all instruction guidelines
2. **Violation Identification** - Document specific non-compliance issues with examples
3. **Priority Classification** - Categorize issues as High/Medium/Low priority
4. **Fix Recommendations** - Provide specific guidance for bringing code into compliance
5. **Report Generation** - Update needsrepair.instruction.md with structured findings
6. **Re-verification** - Follow up reviews to confirm compliance improvements

### Instruction File Synchronization
For keeping instruction files synchronized with the main copilot-instructions.md:

**Pattern:** `I have the main copilot-instructions.md file loaded with [context description]. Update [target-file.md] with any missing [specific content type] from the main file. Focus only on [scope] and [behavioral guidelines].`

**Available Synchronization Targets:**
- `codingconventions.instruction.md` - Coding standards, ReactiveUI patterns, MVVM guidelines
- `ui-generation.instruction.md` - AXAML templates, layout patterns, MTM design guidelines  
- `error_handler-instruction.md` - ReactiveUI error patterns, Avalonia error display
- `naming-conventions.instruction.md` - File naming, ViewModel naming, service naming
- `personas-instruction.md` - Copilot personas, behavioral guidelines
- `ui-mapping.instruction.md` - Control mappings, screenshot relationships
- `needsrepair.instruction.md` - Quality assurance patterns, compliance tracking

### Advanced Context-Aware Updates
Use these patterns for comprehensive instruction file updates:

```
I have the main copilot-instructions.md file loaded with [comprehensive context]. Update [target-instruction.md] with any missing [specific domain knowledge] from the main file. Only add content relevant to [target domain] and maintain existing cross-references.
```

## Rule for Adding Custom Prompts

- **Whenever a new custom prompt is added to this file, an example usage for that prompt must also be added to [custom-prompts-examples.md](custom-prompts-examples.md).**  
  This ensures all prompts are documented with practical examples for reference and consistency.

- **For persona descriptions, see [personas-instruction.md](personas-instruction.md).**

## Persona Behavioral Guidelines

### MTM-Specific Behaviors
All personas should follow these MTM-specific behavioral patterns:

- **Operations are Numbers**: Always treat operations as string numbers ("90", "100", "110"), not action descriptions
- **Part ID Format**: Use string format for Part IDs (e.g., "PART001")
- **1-Based Indexing**: UI positions use 1-based indexing for display
- **Purple Brand Consistency**: Apply MTM purple color scheme (#4B45ED primary, #BA45ED accents)
- **ReactiveUI Patterns**: Use ReactiveObject, RaiseAndSetIfChanged, ReactiveCommand, WhenAnyValue
- **Modern Layout Principles**: Prefer Grid over StackPanel, use cards and sidebars
- **Context Menu Management**: Add right-click functionality for component management
- **Business Logic Separation**: Leave implementation as TODO comments, focus on structure

### Avalonia-Specific Behaviors
- **AXAML Generation**: Use proper xmlns declarations and compiled bindings
- **Control Mapping**: Convert WinForms controls to Avalonia equivalents
- **Theme Resources**: Use DynamicResource for colors to support theming
- **Modern UI Elements**: Implement cards, shadows, gradients, and proper spacing

### Quality Assurance Behaviors
- **Comprehensive Review**: Check all aspects of code against instruction guidelines
- **Structured Reporting**: Use standardized format for violation documentation
- **Priority Assignment**: Classify issues based on impact and compliance severity
- **Solution-Oriented**: Provide specific fix recommendations with instruction references
- **Progress Tracking**: Update compliance status and maintain audit trail
