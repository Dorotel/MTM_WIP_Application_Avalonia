- **Performance**: Compile-time code generation vs runtime reflection
- **Maintainability**: Straightforward property and command patterns
- **Microsoft support**: Official Microsoft toolkit with long-term support
- **Team familiarity**: Closer to traditional MVVM patterns team understands
- **Debugging**: Easier to debug than reactive stream compositions

### **Migration Strategy**
1. **Phase 1**: Create base ViewModel pattern with MVVM Community Toolkit
2. **Phase 2**: Migrate all 42 ViewModels to new pattern
3. **Phase 3**: Remove all ReactiveUI dependencies
4. **Phase 4**: Update all Views to use standard binding patterns

### **Consequences**
**Positive:**
- Reduced complexity in ViewModel implementations
- Better performance with source generators
- Easier onboarding for new developers
- Consistent patterns across all ViewModels

**Negative:**
- Migration effort required for all existing ViewModels
- Loss of reactive programming benefits (not needed for this application)
- Learning curve for MVVM Community Toolkit specifics

### **Implementation Pattern**
```csharp
[ObservableObject]
public partial class ExampleViewModel : BaseViewModel
{
    [ObservableProperty]
    private string property = string.Empty;

    [RelayCommand]
    private async Task ActionAsync()
    {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

## **ADR-003: Stored Procedures Only Database Pattern**

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-10-01  
**Participants**: Database Team, Development Team, Security Team

### **Context**
The MTM manufacturing environment requires high security, audit trails, and consistent data access patterns. The application needed a database access strategy that ensures security, performance, and maintainability.

### **Decision**
Implement a **stored procedures only** database access pattern using `Helper_Database_StoredProcedure.ExecuteDataTableWithStatus()`.

### **Rationale**
- **Security**: Eliminates SQL injection risks completely
- **Performance**: Pre-compiled execution plans
- **Audit trails**: All operations logged at database level
- **Consistency**: Single pattern for all database operations
- **Change control**: Database schema changes controlled through versioned procedures
- **Business logic centralization**: Complex business rules implemented in database layer
- **Manufacturing compliance**: Meets audit requirements for manufacturing environments

### **Implementation Pattern**
```csharp
var parameters = new MySqlParameter[]
{
    new("p_PartID", partId),
    new("p_Operation", operation),
    new("p_Quantity", quantity)
};

var result = await Helper_Database_StoredProcedure.ExecuteDataTableWithStatus(
    connectionString,
    "inv_inventory_Add_Item",
    parameters
);
```

### **Consequences**
**Positive:**
- Maximum security against SQL injection
- Consistent error handling and logging
- Optimal database performance
- Clear separation of concerns
- Audit-compliant operations

**Negative:**
- Database deployment complexity (45+ stored procedures)
- Limited ORM benefits (no Entity Framework)
- Requires database development skills
- More complex unit testing (database dependencies)

### **45+ Stored Procedures Catalog**
- **Inventory**: `inv_inventory_*` (12 procedures)
- **Transactions**: `inv_transaction_*` (8 procedures)  
- **Master Data**: `md_*` (15 procedures)
- **Error Logging**: `log_error_*` (4 procedures)
- **System Maintenance**: `sys_maintenance_*` (6+ procedures)

## **ADR-004: Category-Based Service Consolidation**

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-11-01  
**Participants**: Development Team, Architecture Committee

### **Context**
The application initially had many small, single-purpose services leading to excessive dependency injection complexity and difficult service discovery. A more organized approach was needed.

### **Decision**
Implement **category-based service consolidation** where related functionality is grouped into comprehensive service files.

### **Rationale**
- **Reduced complexity**: Fewer service registrations and dependencies
- **Better discoverability**: Related functionality grouped together
- **Easier maintenance**: Single file contains related operations
- **Clearer ownership**: Each category has clear responsibility boundaries
- **Dependency reduction**: Less circular dependency issues

### **Service Organization Pattern**
```
Services/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Configuration.cs          # ConfigurationService + ApplicationStateService
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Database.cs              # Database connection and helper methods
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ErrorHandling.cs         # ErrorHandling + ErrorEntry + ErrorConfiguration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MasterDataService.cs     # All master data operations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Navigation.cs            # Navigation and routing services
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ QuickButtons.cs          # Quick button management
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ThemeService.cs          # Theme management and application
```
