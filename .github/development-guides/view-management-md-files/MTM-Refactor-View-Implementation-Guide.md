## 📋 Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for refactoring existing views in the MTM WIP Application. Use this when you need to improve code architecture, modernize implementations, consolidate functionality, or align with updated coding standards while maintaining the same external functionality.

## 🎨 Refactoring Patterns

### MVVM Community Toolkit Migration
```csharp
// BEFORE: Legacy MVVM pattern
public class LegacyViewModel : INotifyPropertyChanged
{
    private string _partId = string.Empty;
    public string PartId
    {
        get => _partId;
        set
        {
            _partId = value;
            PropertyChanged?.Invoke(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(nameof(PartId)));
        }
    }
    
    public event PropertyChangedEventHandler? PropertyChanged;
}

// AFTER: MVVM Community Toolkit pattern
[ObservableObject]
public partial class RefactoredViewModel : BaseViewModel
{
    [ObservableProperty]
    private string partId = string.Empty;
}
```

### Service Pattern Modernization
```csharp
// BEFORE: Direct database access in ViewModel
public class LegacyViewModel
{
    public async Task SaveAsync()
    {
        // Direct database code in ViewModel
        var connectionString = ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["Default"];
        using var connection = new MySqlConnection(connectionString);
        // SQL operations...
    }
}

// AFTER: Proper service injection
[ObservableObject]
public partial class RefactoredViewModel : BaseViewModel
{
    private readonly IInventoryService _inventoryService;
    
    public RefactoredViewModel(IInventoryService inventoryService, ILogger<RefactoredViewModel> logger) 
        : base(logger)
    {
        _inventoryService = inventoryService;
    }
    
    [RelayCommand]
    public async Task SaveAsync()
    {
        await ExecuteWithLoadingAsync(async () =>
        {
            var result = await _inventoryService.SaveAsync(/* parameters */);
            // Handle result
        });
    }
}
```

### Theme System Integration
```xml
<!-- BEFORE: Hardcoded colors -->
<Button Background="#0078D4" Foreground="White" />

<!-- AFTER: Dynamic theme resources -->
<Button Background="{DynamicResource MTM_Shared_Logic.PrimaryAction}" 
        Foreground="White" />
```

## 🚨 Refactoring Best Practices

### Code Quality Principles
1. **Single Responsibility**: Each class/method has one clear purpose
2. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Eliminate code duplication
3. **SOLID Principles**: Follow object-oriented design principles
4. **Consistent Patterns**: Use established MTM patterns throughout
5. **Performance First**: Optimize for performance without sacrificing maintainability

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
1. **Incremental Refactoring**: Small, manageable changes
2. **Continuous Testing**: Test after each refactoring step
3. **Feature Flags**: Enable rollback without deployment
4. **Documentation**: Document all changes and decisions
5. **Team Communication**: Keep stakeholders informed
