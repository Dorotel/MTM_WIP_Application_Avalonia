# Focus Management Implementation - MTM WIP Application Avalonia

**Implementation Date:** September 7, 2025  
**Based on:** update-view-answers-2025-09-07T15-04-19-307Z.json  

## üìã Overview

This implementation addresses the requirement to automatically set focus to TabIndex=1 controls during:

1. **Application Startup** - After full theme loading and initialization completes
2. **Tab Switching** - When users switch between inventory management tabs

## üéØ Requirements Addressed

### User Requirements from Questionnaire

- **Target Views**: All views with user input controls that are TabIndexable
- **Current Functionality**: TabIndex 1 needs to be focused upon view activation
- **Update Driver**: Bug fix to improve user experience
- **Critical Constraint**: Must not interfere with SuggestionOverlay functionality that relies on LostFocus triggers

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Implementation

### 1. Focus Management Service

**File:** `Services/FocusManagementService.cs`

```csharp
public interface IFocusManagementService
{
    Task SetInitialFocusAsync(Control view, int delayMs = 100);
    Task SetStartupFocusAsync(Control mainView);
    Task SetTabSwitchFocusAsync(Control mainView, int tabIndex);
}
```

**Key Features:**

- Uses Avalonia's visual tree navigation to find TabIndex=1 controls
- Implements proper delay management to avoid UI interference
- Provides comprehensive logging for debugging
- Thread-safe UI operations using Dispatcher.UIThread.InvokeAsync

### 2. Event-Driven Communication

**File:** `Models/FocusManagementEventArgs.cs`

```csharp
public enum FocusRequestType
{
    Startup,     // Application startup focus
    TabSwitch,   // Tab switching focus  
    ViewSwitch   // View switching focus
}

public class FocusManagementEventArgs : EventArgs
{
    public FocusRequestType FocusType { get; set; }
    public int TabIndex { get; set; }
    public int DelayMs { get; set; } = 100;
}
```

### 3. ViewModel Integration

**File:** `ViewModels/MainForm/MainViewViewModel.cs`

**Added Dependencies:**

- `IFocusManagementService` injected via constructor
- `FocusManagementRequested` event for View communication

**Enhanced Tab Switching:**

```csharp
private void OnTabSelectionChanged(int tabIndex)
{
    // ... existing tab switching logic ...
    
    // Request focus management for the new tab
    RequestTabSwitchFocus(tabIndex);
}
```

**Startup Focus Integration:**

```csharp
public void RequestStartupFocus()
{
    FocusManagementRequested?.Invoke(this, new FocusManagementEventArgs
    {
        FocusType = FocusRequestType.Startup,
        TabIndex = 0,
        DelayMs = 2000 // Wait for full application initialization
    });
}
```

### 4. View Layer Integration

**File:** `Views/MainForm/Panels/MainView.axaml.cs`

**Event Handling:**

```csharp
private async void OnFocusManagementRequested(object? sender, FocusManagementEventArgs e)
{
    var focusService = Program.GetService<IFocusManagementService>();
    
    switch (e.FocusType)
    {
        case FocusRequestType.Startup:
            await focusService.SetStartupFocusAsync(this);
            break;
        case FocusRequestType.TabSwitch:
            await focusService.SetTabSwitchFocusAsync(this, e.TabIndex);
            break;
    }
}
```

## üéÆ TabIndex Implementation

### Inventory Tab (Already Implemented)

**File:** `Views/MainForm/Panels/InventoryTabView.axaml`

- PartTextBox: `TabIndex="1"` ‚úÖ
- OperationTextBox: `TabIndex="2"` ‚úÖ
- LocationTextBox: `TabIndex="3"` ‚úÖ
- QuantityTextBox: `TabIndex="4"` ‚úÖ
- NotesTextBox: `TabIndex="5"` ‚úÖ
- SaveButton: `TabIndex="6"` ‚úÖ

### Remove Tab (Newly Added)

**File:** `Views/MainForm/Panels/RemoveTabView.axaml`

- Part AutoCompleteBox: `TabIndex="1"` ‚úÖ
- Operation AutoCompleteBox: `TabIndex="2"` ‚úÖ

### Transfer Tab (Newly Added)

**File:** `Views/MainForm/Panels/TransferTabView.axaml`

- Part AutoCompleteBox: `TabIndex="1"` ‚úÖ
- Operation AutoCompleteBox: `TabIndex="2"` ‚úÖ
- To Location AutoCompleteBox: `TabIndex="3"` ‚úÖ

## ‚ö° Focus Management Timing

### Application Startup Sequence

1. Application launches and completes initialization
2. MainWindowViewModel.InitializeMainView() creates MainView
3. **NEW:** MainViewViewModel.RequestStartupFocus() is called
4. **2000ms delay** allows for:
   - Theme loading completion
   - Database connection establishment
   - Master data loading
   - UI rendering completion
5. Focus is set to TabIndex=1 of Inventory tab (first tab)

### Tab Switching Sequence

1. User clicks on tab or switches programmatically
2. MainViewViewModel.OnTabSelectionChanged() executes existing logic
3. **NEW:** RequestTabSwitchFocus() fires FocusManagementRequested event
4. **150ms delay** allows for tab switch animation
5. Focus is set to TabIndex=1 of the new tab

## üîÑ Service Registration

**File:** `Extensions/ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs`

```csharp
// Register Focus Management service - singleton for application-wide focus management
services.TryAddSingleton<IFocusManagementService, FocusManagementService>();
```

Added to both:

- Required services validation
- Runtime services validation

## üõ°Ô∏è SuggestionOverlay Compatibility

### Preservation Strategy

The implementation carefully preserves SuggestionOverlay functionality by:

1. **No LostFocus Triggering**: Focus management only sets focus, never artificially triggers LostFocus events
2. **Timing Consideration**: Delays allow existing UI interactions to complete before setting focus
3. **Event Isolation**: Focus management uses separate event channels from SuggestionOverlay triggers

### SuggestionOverlay Flow (Unchanged)

```
User edits PartID/Operation/Location ‚Üí Control loses focus ‚Üí LostFocus event ‚Üí SuggestionOverlay triggers
```

### Focus Management Flow (New)

```
Application startup OR Tab switch ‚Üí FocusManagementRequested event ‚Üí Focus set to TabIndex=1
```

These flows are **completely independent** and do not interfere with each other.

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Application Startup

1. **Expected**: After startup completes (theme loads, etc.), focus automatically goes to PartTextBox in Inventory tab
2. **Verification**: User can immediately start typing without clicking
3. **SuggestionOverlay**: Should still trigger when user moves away from the field

### Scenario 2: Tab Switching - Inventory to Remove

1. **Expected**: When switching to Remove tab, focus goes to Part AutoCompleteBox (TabIndex=1)
2. **Verification**: User can immediately start typing/selecting
3. **SuggestionOverlay**: Should work normally for all controls

### Scenario 3: Tab Switching - Remove to Transfer

1. **Expected**: When switching to Transfer tab, focus goes to Part AutoCompleteBox (TabIndex=1)
2. **Verification**: User can immediately start interacting
3. **SuggestionOverlay**: Should work normally for all controls

### Scenario 4: SuggestionOverlay Compatibility

1. **Expected**: SuggestionOverlay continues to work exactly as before
2. **Verification**: LostFocus events still trigger overlay functionality
3. **No Interference**: Focus management does not disrupt overlay timing or behavior

## üìä Implementation Benefits

### User Experience Improvements

- ‚úÖ **Immediate Productivity**: Users can start typing immediately after startup
- ‚úÖ **Seamless Navigation**: Tab switching focuses first input automatically
- ‚úÖ **Accessibility**: Better keyboard navigation support
- ‚úÖ **Consistency**: Uniform focus behavior across all tabs

### Technical Benefits

- ‚úÖ **Clean Architecture**: Service-based approach with dependency injection
- ‚úÖ **Event-Driven**: Loose coupling between ViewModels and Views
- ‚úÖ **Extensible**: Easy to add focus management to new views
- ‚úÖ **Maintainable**: Centralized focus logic with comprehensive logging
- ‚úÖ **Thread-Safe**: Proper UI thread handling for focus operations

## üîç Implementation Details

### Focus Detection Algorithm

```csharp
// Avalonia-specific TabIndex detection
if (parent.GetValue(KeyboardNavigation.TabIndexProperty) == tabIndex && 
    parent.Focusable && 
    parent.IsVisible)
{
    return parent;
}
```

### Visual Tree Navigation

- Uses `GetVisualChildren().OfType<Control>()` for efficient traversal
- Handles nested UserControls and complex layouts
- Finds controls within TabControl's selected tab content

### Error Handling

- Comprehensive try-catch blocks with logging
- Graceful degradation if focus management fails
- Application continues normally even if focus setting fails

## üöÄ Deployment Considerations

### Build Verification

‚úÖ **Build Status**: All changes compile successfully with no errors  
‚úÖ **Service Registration**: Focus management service properly registered in DI  
‚úÖ **Event Wiring**: All event subscriptions and unsubscriptions implemented  

### Performance Impact

- **Minimal**: Focus operations are async and non-blocking
- **Efficient**: Visual tree searches are bounded by tab content
- **Optimized**: Proper delay timing prevents unnecessary UI operations

### Rollback Plan

If issues arise, focus management can be disabled by:

1. Commenting out `RequestStartupFocus()` call
2. Commenting out `RequestTabSwitchFocus()` call  
3. Application reverts to original behavior
