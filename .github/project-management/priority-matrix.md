# MTM Priority Matrix Implementation

## Overview
The MTM Priority Matrix provides a systematic approach to prioritizing development work based on business value, technical complexity, and resource constraints within the manufacturing inventory management domain.

## Priority Matrix Framework

### Two-Dimensional Priority Assessment

#### **Business Value Axis (Vertical)**
- **Critical Business Value**: Essential for core manufacturing operations
- **High Business Value**: Important for operational efficiency  
- **Medium Business Value**: Valuable but not critical
- **Low Business Value**: Nice-to-have improvements

#### **Implementation Complexity Axis (Horizontal)**  
- **Low Complexity**: Simple, well-understood implementation
- **Medium Complexity**: Moderate technical challenges
- **High Complexity**: Significant technical challenges
- **Very High Complexity**: Major architectural changes required

### Priority Matrix Grid

```
                    Implementation Complexity
                Low    Medium    High    Very High
              ┌─────┬─────────┬───────┬───────────┐
Critical      │  P1 │   P1    │  P2   │    P3     │ Business
              ├─────┼─────────┼───────┼───────────┤ Value
High          │  P1 │   P2    │  P3   │    P4     │

- Weights: 70% business value, 30% implementation simplicity
```

## Priority Assessment Workflow

### 1. Initial Assessment (Automated)
```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow for initial priority assessment
- name: Calculate Initial Priority
  run: |
    # Extract business value indicators from issue content
    BUSINESS_VALUE=5  # Default medium value
    
    # Check for critical business indicators
    if grep -q "Critical.*Application crash\|Data loss\|Security" issue.txt; then
      BUSINESS_VALUE=10
    elif grep -q "High.*Major feature broken\|Production impact" issue.txt; then
      BUSINESS_VALUE=8
    elif grep -q "Medium.*Feature partially\|User experience" issue.txt; then
      BUSINESS_VALUE=6
    elif grep -q "Low.*Minor issue\|Cosmetic" issue.txt; then
      BUSINESS_VALUE=3
    fi
    
    # Calculate complexity based on PR size estimation and component count
    COMPLEXITY=5  # Default medium complexity
    AFFECTED_COMPONENTS=$(echo "$CHANGED_FILES" | grep -E "(ViewModels|Services|Views|Models|Database)" | wc -l)
    
    if [ $AFFECTED_COMPONENTS -gt 4 ]; then
      COMPLEXITY=9
    elif [ $AFFECTED_COMPONENTS -gt 2 ]; then
      COMPLEXITY=7
    elif [ $AFFECTED_COMPONENTS -eq 1 ]; then
      COMPLEXITY=3
    fi
    
    # Calculate priority score
    PRIORITY_SCORE=$(echo "scale=2; ($BUSINESS_VALUE * 0.7) + ((10 - $COMPLEXITY) * 0.3)" | bc)
    
    echo "Business Value: $BUSINESS_VALUE"
    echo "Implementation Complexity: $COMPLEXITY"
    echo "Priority Score: $PRIORITY_SCORE"
```

### 2. Expert Review Process

   - Considers operational impact and timing

2. **Technical Lead Review** (Implementation Complexity)
   - Validates technical complexity assessment
   - Considers architectural implications
   - Evaluates resource requirements

3. **Product Owner Review** (Final Priority)
   - Reviews business value in context of roadmap
   - Considers strategic alignment
   - Makes final priority determination

### 3. Priority Assignment Labels
```yaml
# Automatic label application based on priority score
priority:P1-immediate    # Score 8.0-10.0
priority:P2-high        # Score 6.5-7.9
priority:P3-medium      # Score 5.0-6.4
priority:P4-low         # Score 3.5-4.9
priority:P5-very-low    # Score 2.0-3.4
