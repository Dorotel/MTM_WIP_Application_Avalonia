      label: "Current Behavior & Limitations"
      description: "Describe how the functionality currently works and its limitations"
      placeholder: |
        **Current Implementation:**
        - QuickButtons panel supports drag-and-drop reordering
        - Uses MVVM Community Toolkit [RelayCommand] for drag operations
        - Persists button order via stored procedure
        
        **Current Limitations:**
        - Performance degrades significantly with >15 buttons
        - No visual feedback during drag operations beyond cursor change
        - Reorder operation is synchronous, causing UI freeze for 500ms+
        - No batching of position updates leads to multiple database calls
        - Touch input on tablets is less responsive than mouse input
        
        **User Pain Points:**
        - Operators report sluggish response during busy periods
        - No indication of drag operation success/failure
        - Difficulty using on tablet devices in manufacturing environment

        - Add UI virtualization container for button collection
        
        **Performance Optimizations:**
        ```csharp
        // Async command with progress indication
        [RelayCommand]
        private async Task ReorderButtonsAsync(ButtonReorderInfo reorderInfo)
        {
            IsReordering = true;
            try
            {
                // Optimistic UI update
                ApplyReorderToUI(reorderInfo);
                
                // Batched database update
                await _quickButtonService.BatchUpdatePositionsAsync(reorderInfo.Changes);
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                // Rollback UI changes
                RollbackReorderUI(reorderInfo);
                await HandleErrorAsync(ex, "reordering buttons");
            }
            finally
            {
                IsReordering = false;
            }
        }
