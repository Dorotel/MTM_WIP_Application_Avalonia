## üìä Progress Reporting Requirements

All progress updates during testing implementation must use a simple, standardized format for maximum clarity and efficiency:

### Required Update Report Format
```
## Testing Implementation Progress Report

**Progress**: [Completed Tests] / [Total Tests] ([Percentage]%)
**Current Phase**: [Phase Number] - [Phase Name]  
**Current Task**: [Current Testing Task] - [Brief Task Description]

**Implementation Plan Updated**: ‚úÖ Tasks [Start-Number] through [End-Number] marked complete
**Task Status**: [Number] testing tasks updated with completion dates

**Relevant Notes**: 
- [Key testing observation or issue encountered]
- [Important testing decision made or pattern discovered]
- [Any testing blockers or dependencies identified]

**Completed Test Files This Session**:

- [Additional test files as applicable]

**Next Actions**: 
- [Immediate next testing task to be executed]
- [Any test infrastructure preparation needed]
- Update testing progress tracking for next batch of tests
```

### Testing Progress Standards
- Updates required every 5 completed testing tasks (at each checkpoint)
- Keep test descriptions concise and actionable
- Focus on concrete testing progress rather than process details
- Highlight any test failures, coverage gaps, or unexpected testing discoveries

## Agent-Driven Testing Implementation Prompt

When executing this testing epic as an agent-driven implementation, use the following prompt for systematic execution:

```prompt
# MTM Testing Infrastructure Implementation - Phase 2 Execution

## Context
You are executing the MTM Comprehensive Testing Infrastructure Implementation - Phase 2. This is a comprehensive testing project covering 5 testing tiers (Unit, Integration, UI, Database, Performance) plus Cross-Platform validation for the MTM WIP Application.

## Your Testing Mission
Execute testing tasks systematically following the epic implementation plan. You must:

1. **Follow the exact testing tier sequence** outlined in the implementation phases
2. **Provide testing progress reports** every 5 completed tasks using the standardized format
3. **Create comprehensive test files** for all ViewModels, Services, Views, and stored procedures
4. **Validate test coverage and quality** before proceeding to next testing tier
5. **Maintain testing standards** and MTM architecture compliance throughout

## Critical Testing Requirements
- **Follow MTM patterns** - MVVM Community Toolkit, stored procedures only, Avalonia syntax
- **Achieve 95%+ code coverage** on ViewModels and Services
- **Test all 45+ stored procedures** for performance and integrity
- **Implement cross-platform testing** for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android
- **Maintain manufacturing domain context** in all test scenarios
- **Update progress tracking** in real-time to avoid duplicate testing efforts

## Testing Execution Process
1. **Read the full testing epic** to understand scope and coverage requirements
2. **Check existing test completion status** before starting any test development
3. **Start with Phase 2A, Tier 1** - Unit testing for ViewModels and Services
4. **Execute testing tiers sequentially** within each phase
5. **IMMEDIATELY update progress tracking** when tests are completed
6. **Report testing progress** at each checkpoint (every 5 testing tasks)
7. **Validate test quality and coverage** before marking tasks as complete
8. **Update the epic documentation** with completion dates and test metrics

## Testing Success Metrics
- **500+ comprehensive tests** across all 5 testing tiers
- **95%+ code coverage** on critical manufacturing workflows
- **<200ms response time** validation for all manufacturing operations
- **100% cross-platform compatibility** on Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Zero false positive test failures** in automated test runs
- **All 45+ stored procedures** performance validated

## Testing Emergency Protocols
- If any test tier encounters critical failures, document in progress report
- If testing framework compatibility issues arise, pause and investigate
- If manufacturing workflow tests fail, validate against actual business logic
- If cross-platform tests fail, isolate platform-specific issues

**Start Testing Execution**: Begin with Phase 2A, Task 1 (Unit Test Implementation) and provide your first testing progress report after completing the first 5 unit test files.
```

This prompt should be used to initialize any agent that will continue this testing implementation work.
