      value: |
        **Technical Considerations**:
        
        **CollapsiblePanel Preservation**:
        - Preserve existing working CollapsiblePanel implementation
        - Enhance auto-collapse/expand behavior for Search/Reset operations
        - Maintain additional right-side panel (not in documentation but implemented)
        - Ensure smooth animations and proper state management
        
        **View-Based Undo System**:
        - Design undo system specific to this view (not application-wide)
        - Implement proper state management for undo operations
        - Create transaction tracking for undo capabilities
        - Ensure proper validation and business rule enforcement for undo
        
        **Bulk Removal Architecture**:
        - Design for scalability with large bulk removal operations
        - Implement efficient batch processing with progress callbacks
        - Use async patterns to prevent UI blocking during bulk operations
        - Consider memory management for large removal datasets
        
        **ViewModel Expansion**:
        - Expand AdvancedRemoveViewModel with comprehensive bulk capabilities
        - Implement view-based undo command patterns
        - Add removal analytics and reporting functionality
        - Integrate history management capabilities
        
        **Database Integration**:
        - Use existing stored procedures where possible
        - Implement bulk database operations efficiently
        - Ensure proper transaction handling for atomic bulk operations
        - Add progress reporting for long-running database operations
        
        **QuickButtons Integration**:
        - All successful removals create OUT transactions
        - All removals appear in QuickButtons history with RED color coding
        - Bulk operations create multiple QuickButton entries as appropriate
        - Undo operations may create corresponding history entries
        
        **Performance Optimization**:
        - Implement efficient bulk removal processing algorithms
        - Use proper data binding patterns to minimize UI updates
        - Optimize DataGrid rendering for large removal datasets
        - Cache frequently used data for improved responsiveness
        
        **Error Handling**:
        - Design comprehensive error handling for bulk removal operations
        - Provide detailed error reporting for failed bulk items
        - Implement partial success scenarios handling
        - Ensure proper error logging and user feedback
        - Handle undo operation failures gracefully
