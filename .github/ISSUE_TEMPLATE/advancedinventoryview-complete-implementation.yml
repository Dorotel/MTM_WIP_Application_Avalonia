        - Expand AdvancedInventoryViewModel with comprehensive bulk capabilities
        - Implement proper command patterns for bulk operations
        - Add template management functionality
        - Integrate analytics and reporting capabilities
        
        **Database Integration**:
        - Use existing stored procedures where possible
        - Implement bulk database operations efficiently
        - Ensure proper transaction handling for atomic bulk operations
        - Add progress reporting for long-running database operations
        
        **QuickButtons Integration (CRITICAL)**:
        - MUST behave exactly like InventoryTabView for saves
        - All successful inventory additions create IN transactions
        - All saves appear in QuickButtons history with Green color coding
        - Bulk operations create multiple QuickButton entries as appropriate
        
        **Template System**:
        - Design flexible template structure for various bulk scenarios
        - Implement template validation and error checking
        - Provide user-friendly template management interface
        - Consider template sharing and import/export capabilities
        
        **Performance Optimization**:
        - Implement efficient bulk processing algorithms
        - Use proper data binding patterns to minimize UI updates
        - Optimize DataGrid rendering for large bulk datasets
        - Cache frequently used data for improved responsiveness
        
        **Error Handling**:
        - Design comprehensive error handling for bulk operations
        - Provide detailed error reporting for failed bulk items
        - Implement partial success scenarios handling
        - Ensure proper error logging and user feedback
