      value: |
        **Technical Considerations**:
        
        **CollapsiblePanel Integration**:
        - Use existing CollapsiblePanel.axaml from Controls folder
        - Implement auto-collapse on Search (preserve manual user expand state)
        - Implement auto-expand on Reset (don't toggle if already expanded)
        - Smooth animation transitions for professional user experience
        
        **ViewModel Integration**:
        - RemoveItemViewModel (769 lines) contains complete business logic
        - Connect existing commands to new UI elements
        - Ensure proper data binding for all collections and properties
        - Implement proper disposal patterns for view cleanup
        
        **Database Operations**:
        - Use existing stored procedures from RemoveItemViewModel
        - Ensure proper async patterns to prevent UI blocking
        - Implement progress callbacks for long-running operations
        - Handle database errors gracefully with user feedback
        
        **Theme Consistency**:
        - Follow InventoryTabView.axaml patterns exactly
        - Use MTM_Shared_Logic resource references
        - Maintain consistent spacing, colors, and typography
        - Ensure compatibility with all 19 MTM themes
        
        **Performance Optimization**:
        - Implement virtual scrolling for large datasets if needed
        - Use proper data binding patterns to minimize UI updates
        - Cache suggestion overlay data for improved responsiveness
        - Optimize batch operations for large selections
        
        **Error Scenarios**:
