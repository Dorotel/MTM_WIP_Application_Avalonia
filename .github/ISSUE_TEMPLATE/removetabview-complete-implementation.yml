        # üóëÔ∏è Complete RemoveTabView Implementation
        
        **Current Development Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEEDS COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION**
        
        ## üìä Progress Summary
        
        ### ‚úÖ **Completed Components:**
        - Basic AXAML structure with styling (70% theme compliance)
        - RemoveItemViewModel with comprehensive business logic
        - Integration with existing MTM database stored procedures
        - Existing documentation and UI guidelines
        
        ### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Issues:**
        - **AXAML Structure**: Missing mandatory Tab View pattern (ScrollViewer + Grid)
        - **UI Implementation**: Incomplete form fields and DataGrid implementation
        - **ViewModel Integration**: Missing proper DataContext binding patterns
        - **Button Functionality**: Action buttons not properly implemented
        - **Search Operations**: Search and filter controls need completion
        
        ### üîÑ **Reference Implementation:**
        Using InventoryTabView.axaml as the pattern template:
        - ScrollViewer > Grid[RowDefinitions="*,Auto"] > Border structure
        - Proper MaterialIcons integration with labels
        - Complete form field implementation with validation
        - MTM mandatory grid pattern compliance

        **üîç AXAML Structure Analysis:**
        
        ## ‚úÖ InventoryTabView.axaml Pattern (Reference):
        ```xml
        <ScrollViewer HorizontalScrollBarVisibility="Auto" VerticalScrollBarVisibility="Auto">
          <Grid x:Name="MainContainer" RowDefinitions="*,Auto" MinWidth="600" MinHeight="400" Margin="8">
            <!-- Main Entry Panel -->
            <Border Grid.Row="0" Background="{DynamicResource MTM_Shared_Logic.PanelBackgroundBrush}">
              <Grid x:Name="EntryFormGrid" RowDefinitions="Auto,*">
                <!-- Header Section -->
                <Border Grid.Row="0" Background="{DynamicResource MTM_Shared_Logic.SidebarGradientBrush}">
                  <Grid x:Name="HeaderGrid" ColumnDefinitions="Auto,*">
                    <materialIcons:MaterialIcon Grid.Column="0" Kind="Package" />
                    <TextBlock Grid.Column="1" Text="MTM Inventory Entry" />
                  </Grid>
                </Border>
                <!-- Form Fields Section -->
                <Grid x:Name="FormFieldsGrid" Grid.Row="1" RowDefinitions="Auto,Auto,Auto,Auto,*">
                  <!-- Individual form fields with icons and labels -->
                </Grid>
              </Grid>
            </Border>
            <!-- Action Buttons Panel -->
            <Border Grid.Row="1" Background="{DynamicResource MTM_Shared_Logic.PanelBackgroundBrush}">
              <Grid x:Name="ActionButtonsGrid" ColumnDefinitions="Auto,*">
                <!-- Action buttons with proper styling -->
              </Grid>
            </Border>
          </Grid>
        </ScrollViewer>
        ```
        
        ## ‚ùå Current RemoveTabView.axaml Issues:
        
        ### Missing Core Structure:
        - ‚ùå No proper ScrollViewer > Grid[*,Auto] pattern
        - ‚ùå Incomplete form field implementations (empty StackPanels)
        - ‚ùå Missing MaterialIcons + TextBlock label combinations
        - ‚ùå Incomplete DataGrid implementation in right panel
        - ‚ùå Missing proper header section with gradient background
        - ‚ùå Action buttons panel not properly implemented
        
        ### Incomplete Control Implementations:
        ```xml
        <!-- CURRENT (Incomplete): -->
        <StackPanel>
          <!-- Empty StackPanel placeholders -->
        </StackPanel>
        
        <!-- SHOULD BE (Following InventoryTabView pattern): -->
        <Grid x:Name="PartIdGrid" Grid.Row="0" ColumnDefinitions="90,*" ColumnSpacing="12">
          <StackPanel Grid.Column="0" Orientation="Horizontal" Spacing="6">
            <materialIcons:MaterialIcon Kind="Package" Width="14" Height="14" />
            <TextBlock Text="Part ID:" FontSize="12" FontWeight="Medium" />
          </StackPanel>
          <TextBox Grid.Column="1" Text="{Binding SelectedPart, Mode=TwoWay}" Classes="input-field" />
        </Grid>
        ```
        
        ### Missing ViewModel Integration:
        - ‚ùå No DataContext binding to RemoveItemViewModel
        - ‚ùå Missing Command bindings (SearchCommand, DeleteCommand, UndoCommand)
        - ‚ùå Missing property bindings for search criteria
        - ‚ùå Missing ObservableCollection bindings for DataGrid
        
        ### Required Implementation Tasks:
        1. **Complete AXAML Structure** - Implement full ScrollViewer + Grid pattern
        2. **Form Fields Implementation** - Part ID, Operation ComboBoxes with icons
        3. **DataGrid Integration** - Bind to InventoryItems ObservableCollection
        4. **Action Buttons Implementation** - Search, Delete, Undo, Print, Advanced
        5. **Progress Integration** - Loading states and progress feedback
        6. **Validation States** - Error styling and validation feedback
        
        ### RemoveItemViewModel Integration Points:
        ```csharp
        // Available Properties for Binding:
        - ObservableCollection<string> PartOptions
        - ObservableCollection<string> OperationOptions  
        - ObservableCollection<InventoryItem> InventoryItems
        - ObservableCollection<InventoryItem> SelectedItems
        
        // Available Commands for Binding:
        - RelayCommand SearchCommand
        - RelayCommand DeleteCommand
        - RelayCommand UndoCommand
        - RelayCommand ResetCommand
        - RelayCommand PrintCommand

      value: |
        ## Primary Success Criteria:
        
        ### UI Implementation:

        - [ ] Action buttons panel matches InventoryTabView styling and layout
        - [ ] All MTM theme resources used correctly (no hardcoded colors)
        
        ### Functionality:
        - [ ] Search operations filter inventory correctly by part ID and/or operation
        - [ ] Multi-row selection works in DataGrid for batch operations

        - [ ] Undo operations restore items with proper audit trail
        - [ ] Empty search results show appropriate "Nothing Found" indicator
        
        ### Technical Compliance:
        - [ ] Uses MVVM Community Toolkit patterns exclusively

    attributes:
      label: "üí≠ Additional Requirements & Notes"
      value: |
        **Development Context:**
        - Base implementation on InventoryTabView.axaml patterns for consistency
        - Leverage existing RemoveItemViewModel (769 lines) with comprehensive business logic
        - Use established MTM database stored procedures (inv_inventory_Remove_Item, etc.)
        - Integrate with existing Services/ErrorHandling.cs for centralized error management
        
        **Reference Files for Implementation:**
        - Views/MainForm/Panels/InventoryTabView.axaml (pattern template)
        - ViewModels/MainForm/RemoveItemViewModel.cs (existing ViewModel)
        - Documentation/Development/UI_Documentation/Controls/MainForm/Control_RemoveTab.instructions.md
        - docs/ui-theme-readiness/RemoveTabView_theme_readiness_checklist.md
        
        **Key Implementation Notes:**
        - Must resolve documentation conflicts using InventoryTabView as authoritative pattern
        - DataGrid implementation should show Location, PartID, Operation, Quantity columns minimum
        - Undo functionality should maintain _lastRemovedItems collection as documented
        - Print functionality should use Core_DgvPrinter equivalent for Avalonia
        - Advanced Removal button should integrate with future Control_AdvancedRemove implementation
        
        **Known Challenges:**
        - Converting WinForms DataGridView concepts to Avalonia DataGrid
        - Implementing progress feedback without WinForms ToolStripProgressBar
        - Ensuring batch operation performance with large datasets
        - Maintaining transaction integrity during partial operation failures
