# MTM Component Library Documentation

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

This document provides comprehensive documentation for all reusable UI components in the MTM WIP Application, including implementation details, usage guidelines, and architectural requirements for maintaining consistency across the manufacturing workflow interface.

**Currently Implemented Components:**

- **CollapsiblePanel** - Expandable/collapsible container for organizing content
- **CustomDataGrid** - Advanced data grid with filtering, column management, and manufacturing-specific features
- **TransactionExpandableButton** - Interactive button for transaction history display

## ðŸ§± **Core Component Architecture**

### **Service Integration Pattern**

The MTM application follows a consistent pattern for component integration with the application's service layer through dependency injection. All components should access services through Application.Current.Services when needed.

**Required Integration Approach:**

- Components should access `ILogger<ComponentType>` for consistent logging
- Service dependencies should be resolved in component constructors
- Error handling should use ServiceResult pattern from service layer
- All database operations must go through appropriate service interfaces (never direct database access)

### **MVVM Community Toolkit Integration**

All components must integrate seamlessly with MVVM Community Toolkit 8.3.2 patterns:

**Property Binding Requirements:**

- Use ObservableProperty source generators in ViewModels
- Support two-way binding for input components
- Implement PropertyChanged notifications appropriately
- Follow RelayCommand patterns for user actions

**Data Binding Standards:**

- All bindable properties must be StyledProperty definitions
- Support both ItemsSource and individual property binding patterns
- Implement proper default values and validation
