# TASK-027: Context Files Creation and Validation

**Date**: 2025-09-14  
**Phase**: 4 - Additional Documentation Components  
**Task**: Create and validate context files for GitHub Copilot integration

## Overview

Task 027 focuses on creating comprehensive context files that provide GitHub Copilot with domain-specific knowledge about the MTM WIP Application, manufacturing workflows, technology patterns, and business rules.

## Context File Categories

### 1. Technology Context Files
- [ ] MTM technology stack context (.NET 8, Avalonia, MVVM Toolkit, MySQL)
- [ ] Cross-platform development context
- [ ] Avalonia UI specific context
- [ ] Database patterns context

### 2. Business Domain Context Files  
- [ ] Manufacturing inventory management context
- [ ] Part ID and operation workflow context
- [ ] Transaction types and business rules context
- [ ] QuickButtons and user workflow context

### 3. Architecture Context Files
- [ ] Service layer architecture context
- [ ] MVVM Community Toolkit patterns context
- [ ] Dependency injection context
- [ ] Error handling and logging context

### 4. Development Context Files
- [ ] Code review standards context
- [ ] Testing patterns context
- [ ] Performance optimization context
- [ ] Security and validation context

## Task 027 Actions

### 027a: Technology Stack Context Creation
Create context files that provide comprehensive technology knowledge:

1. **MTM Technology Context** (`mtm-technology-context.md`)
   - .NET 8 and C# 12 specific patterns
   - Avalonia UI 11.3.4 cross-platform requirements
   - MVVM Community Toolkit 8.3.2 source generator patterns
   - MySQL 9.4.0 stored procedures only approach

2. **Cross-Platform Context** (`mtm-cross-platform-context.md`)
   - Platform-specific considerations (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android)
   - File system and path handling differences
   - Performance characteristics across platforms
   - UI rendering and behavior differences

### 027b: Business Domain Context Creation
Create context files for manufacturing domain knowledge:

1. **Manufacturing Context** (`mtm-manufacturing-context.md`)
   - Inventory management workflows
   - Manufacturing operation sequences
   - Transaction types and business rules
   - Part ID validation and formatting

2. **User Workflow Context** (`mtm-user-workflow-context.md`)
   - QuickButtons functionality and purpose
   - Common user scenarios and patterns
   - UI/UX design principles
   - Error handling and user feedback

### 027c: Architecture Context Creation
Create context files for technical architecture:

1. **Service Architecture Context** (`mtm-service-architecture-context.md`)
   - Service layer organization and patterns
   - Dependency injection configuration
   - Database service integration patterns
   - Error handling and logging strategies

2. **MVVM Context** (`mtm-mvvm-context.md`)
   - ViewModels structure and patterns
   - Property and command implementation
   - Data binding best practices
   - View lifecycle management

### 027d: Development Context Creation
Create context files for development processes:

1. **Code Quality Context** (`mtm-code-quality-context.md`)
   - Code review standards and checklists
   - Testing requirements and patterns
   - Performance benchmarks and targets
   - Security validation requirements

2. **Integration Context** (`mtm-integration-context.md`)
   - Service integration patterns
   - Database transaction handling
   - Cross-service communication
   - Error propagation and recovery

## Context File Structure Template

Each context file should follow this structure:

```markdown
---
description: 'Context file description'
context_type: 'technology|business|architecture|development'
applies_to: '**/*'
priority: 'high|medium|low'
---

# [Context Name] - MTM WIP Application Context

## Context Overview
[Brief description of what this context provides]

## Key Concepts
[Core concepts and definitions]

## Patterns and Examples
