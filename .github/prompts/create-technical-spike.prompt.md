## Implementation Mode

**CRITICAL**: You MUST implement all code changes directly using available tools. Do NOT provide code snippets or examples for the user to implement manually. When you identify issues, fixes, improvements, or requirements:

1. **Immediate Implementation**: Use edit tools to make actual changes to files
2. **Direct Action**: Create, modify, or update files as needed
3. **No Code Examples**: Avoid showing code blocks unless specifically requested for explanation
4. **Tool-First Approach**: Leverage all available tools to accomplish tasks programmatically
5. **Complete Solutions**: Finish implementation work rather than providing guidance

Your role is to **execute and implement**, not to advise or provide examples for manual implementation.


# Create Technical Spike Document

Create time-boxed technical spike documents for researching critical questions that must be answered before development can proceed. Each spike focuses on a specific technical decision with clear deliverables and timelines.

## Document Structure

Create individual files in `${input:FolderPath|docs/spikes}` directory. Name each file using the pattern: `[category]-[short-description]-spike.md` (e.g., `api-copilot-integration-spike.md`, `performance-realtime-audio-spike.md`).

```md

title: "${input:SpikeTitle}"
category: "${input:Category|Technical}"
status: "ðŸ”´ Not Started"
priority: "${input:Priority|High}"
timebox: "${input:Timebox|1 week}"
created: [YYYY-MM-DD]
updated: [YYYY-MM-DD]
owner: "${input:Owner}"
tags: ["technical-spike", "${input:Category|technical}", "research"]

## Categories for Technical Spikes

### API Integration

- Third-party API capabilities and limitations
- Integration patterns and authentication
- Rate limits and performance characteristics

### Architecture & Design

- System architecture decisions
- Design pattern applicability
- Component interaction models

### Performance & Scalability

- Performance requirements and constraints
- Scalability bottlenecks and solutions
- Resource utilization patterns

### Platform & Infrastructure

- Platform capabilities and limitations
- Infrastructure requirements
- Deployment and hosting considerations

### Security & Compliance

- Security requirements and implementations
- Compliance constraints
- Authentication and authorization approaches

### User Experience

- User interaction patterns
- Accessibility requirements
- Interface design decisions

## File Naming Conventions

Use descriptive, kebab-case names that indicate the category and specific unknown:

**API/Integration Examples:**

- `api-copilot-chat-integration-spike.md`
- `api-azure-speech-realtime-spike.md`
- `api-vscode-extension-capabilities-spike.md`

**Performance Examples:**

- `performance-audio-processing-latency-spike.md`
- `performance-extension-host-limitations-spike.md`
- `performance-webrtc-reliability-spike.md`

**Architecture Examples:**

- `architecture-voice-pipeline-design-spike.md`
- `architecture-state-management-spike.md`
- `architecture-error-handling-strategy-spike.md`

## Best Practices for AI Agents

1. **One Question Per Spike:** Each document focuses on a single technical decision or research question

2. **Time-Boxed Research:** Define specific time limits and deliverables for each spike

3. **Evidence-Based Decisions:** Require concrete evidence (tests, prototypes, documentation) before marking as complete

4. **Clear Recommendations:** Document specific recommendations and rationale for implementation

5. **Dependency Tracking:** Identify how spikes relate to each other and impact project decisions

6. **Outcome-Focused:** Every spike must result in an actionable decision or recommendation

## Research Strategy

### Phase 1: Information Gathering

1. **Search existing documentation** using search/fetch tools
2. **Analyze codebase** for existing patterns and constraints
3. **Research external resources** (APIs, libraries, examples)

### Phase 2: Validation & Testing

1. **Create focused prototypes** to test specific hypotheses
2. **Run targeted experiments** to validate assumptions
3. **Document test results** with supporting evidence

### Phase 3: Decision & Documentation

1. **Synthesize findings** into clear recommendations
2. **Document implementation guidance** for development team
3. **Create follow-up tasks** for implementation

## Tools Usage

- **search/searchResults:** Research existing solutions and documentation
- **fetch/githubRepo:** Analyze external APIs, libraries, and examples
- **codebase:** Understand existing system constraints and patterns
- **runTasks:** Execute prototypes and validation tests
- **editFiles:** Update research progress and findings
- **vscodeAPI:** Test VS Code extension capabilities and limitations

Focus on time-boxed research that resolves critical technical decisions and unblocks development progress.
