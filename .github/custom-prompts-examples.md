Include specific code examples of violations and required fixes with priority levels.

**Advanced Example:**  
Review the entire Views/ and ViewModels/ directories for compliance with all MTM WIP Application instruction guidelines. Generate a comprehensive report in needsrepair.instruction.md identifying violations across naming conventions, ReactiveUI patterns, MTM data handling, Avalonia UI standards, color scheme usage, and architecture guidelines. Prioritize fixes by impact and provide specific implementation guidance with instruction file references.

**Specific File Example:**  
Review Views/MainView.axaml and ViewModels/MainViewModel.cs for compliance with all MTM WIP Application instruction guidelines. Generate a detailed report in needsrepair.instruction.md identifying violations and required fixes.

**Bulk Assessment Example:**  
Conduct comprehensive quality audit of MTM_WIP_Application_Avalonia project. Review all C# and AXAML files for MTM compliance. Generate prioritized repair list in needsrepair.instruction.md with specific fix recommendations and instruction file references. Include compliance metrics and implementation roadmap.

**Domain-Specific Example:**  
Review all error handling implementations across the project for compliance with errorhandler.instruction.md guidelines. Generate focused compliance report in needsrepair.instruction.md identifying missing error patterns, logging inconsistencies, and user experience violations. Provide specific remediation steps for each finding.
