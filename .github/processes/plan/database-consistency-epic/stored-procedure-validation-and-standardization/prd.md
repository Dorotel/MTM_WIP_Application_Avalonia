# Database Consistency and Error Handling Standardization

## Epic
- **Parent Epic**: Database Consistency and Stored Procedure Standardization
- **Architecture Document**: [To be created - Database Architecture Patterns](../database-architecture-patterns.md)

## Goal

**Problem:** The MTM WIP Application currently has inconsistent error handling patterns across stored procedures and their calling code, leading to unpredictable behavior and difficult debugging. Some stored procedures follow different output parameter patterns (status/message), while others may not follow any standard. The application code calling these procedures may not be handling responses consistently, creating potential runtime errors and data integrity issues.

**Solution:** Implement a comprehensive validation and standardization system that:
1. Validates all currently used stored procedures against the database schema
2. Ensures all calling code uses correct parameter names and types
3. Standardizes error handling across all stored procedures to use a consistent pattern (-1 = error, 0 = no data returned, 1 = success with data)
4. Updates unused stored procedures to follow the same standard for future consistency

**Impact:** This will result in reliable error handling, consistent database interaction patterns, improved debugging capabilities, and a solid foundation for future database operations. It will eliminate runtime errors caused by parameter mismatches and provide predictable behavior across all database operations.

## User Personas

- **MTM Application Developers**: Need consistent, reliable database interaction patterns
- **MTM System Administrators**: Require predictable error handling and logging for troubleshooting
- **MTM End Users**: Benefit from stable application behavior and clear error messages
- **Database Administrators**: Need standardized stored procedure patterns for maintenance and monitoring

## User Stories

### Primary User Stories

1. **As an MTM Application Developer**, I want all stored procedure calls to use correct parameter names and types so that I don't encounter runtime parameter mismatch errors.

2. **As an MTM Application Developer**, I want consistent error handling patterns (-1/0/1) across all stored procedures so that I can write predictable error handling code.

3. **As an MTM System Administrator**, I want standardized error responses from all database operations so that I can quickly identify and troubleshoot issues.

4. **As an MTM Application Developer**, I want all unused stored procedures to follow the same standards as active ones so that future development maintains consistency.

5. **As a Database Administrator**, I want all stored procedures to follow the same output parameter naming conventions (@p_Status, @p_ErrorMsg) so that monitoring and maintenance are consistent.

### Edge Case Stories

6. **As an MTM Application Developer**, I want clear validation reports showing which stored procedures were updated so that I can verify changes don't break existing functionality.

7. **As an MTM System Administrator**, I want backward compatibility maintained during the standardization process so that the application continues to function during updates.

8. **As an MTM Application Developer**, I want documentation of all parameter changes so that I can update any custom code that might be affected.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Phase 1: Validation and Assessment
- **FR-1.1**: Scan all C# code files to identify every stored procedure call using `Helper_Database_StoredProcedure.ExecuteDataTableWithStatus()` and `Helper_Database_StoredProcedure.ExecuteWithStatus()`
- **FR-1.2**: Cross-reference each stored procedure call with the actual stored procedure definition in the database schema files
- **FR-1.3**: Validate that all parameter names used in the C# code match the parameter names defined in the stored procedures
- **FR-1.4**: Validate that all parameter types used in the C# code are compatible with the stored procedure parameter types
- **FR-1.5**: Generate a comprehensive report of all mismatches found between code and stored procedures

#### Phase 2: Code Correction
- **FR-2.1**: Update all C# code that has parameter name mismatches to use the correct parameter names from the stored procedures
- **FR-2.2**: Update all C# code that has parameter type mismatches to use compatible types
- **FR-2.3**: Ensure all database calls use the standardized error handling pattern for processing status codes
- **FR-2.4**: Update error handling logic to consistently interpret -1 as error, 0 as no data, and 1 as success

#### Phase 3: Stored Procedure Standardization
- **FR-3.1**: Update all currently used stored procedures to follow the standard output parameter pattern (@p_Status INT, @p_ErrorMsg VARCHAR(255))
- **FR-3.2**: Implement consistent status code logic in all stored procedures: -1 for errors, 0 for no data returned, 1 for success with data
- **FR-3.3**: Ensure all stored procedures properly handle and report errors through the standardized output parameters
- **FR-3.4**: Update all unused stored procedures to follow the same standardization pattern for future consistency

#### Phase 4: File Synchronization
- **FR-4.1**: Update the `Updated_Stored_Procedures.sql` file with all standardized stored procedure definitions
- **FR-4.2**: Replace the contents of `Development_Stored_Procedures.sql` with the contents of `Updated_Stored_Procedures.sql` to maintain file synchronization
- **FR-4.3**: Validate that both files contain identical stored procedure definitions

#### Phase 5: Validation Testing
- **FR-5.1**: Test all updated stored procedure calls to ensure they work correctly with the standardized parameters
- **FR-5.2**: Verify that error handling behaves consistently across all database operations
- **FR-5.3**: Confirm that the status code standardization works as expected (-1/0/1 pattern)

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-1**: **Backward Compatibility**: All changes must maintain backward compatibility during the update process to ensure the application continues to function
- **NFR-2**: **Performance**: Stored procedure updates must not negatively impact database query performance
- **NFR-3**: **Data Integrity**: All database operations must maintain data integrity throughout the standardization process
- **NFR-4**: **Error Reporting**: All validation and update processes must provide detailed logging and error reporting
- **NFR-5**: **Documentation**: All changes must be thoroughly documented with before/after comparisons
- **NFR-6**: **Rollback Capability**: The system must support rollback of changes if issues are discovered
- **NFR-7**: **Consistency**: All stored procedures must follow identical naming conventions and parameter patterns
- **NFR-8**: **Maintainability**: The standardized patterns must be maintainable and easy to understand for future developers
