# MTM Custom Data Grid Control

## Epic

**Parent Epic:** Inventory Management UI Overhaul  
**Related Documents:**
- Epic PRD: `/docs/ways-of-work/plan/inventory-management-ui-overhaul/epic-prd.md` *(to be created)*
- Architecture Document: `/docs/ways-of-work/plan/inventory-management-ui-overhaul/architecture.md` *(to be created)*

## Goal

### Problem
The current standard DataGrid implementation in MTM's inventory management views (RemoveTabView, TransferTabView) suffers from poor performance with large datasets (1000+ inventory items), limited customization options, and inconsistent user experience across different manufacturing workflows. Users struggle with data visualization bottlenecks, cannot personalize their workspace according to their specific operational needs, and experience workflow interruptions due to inflexible grid interactions. Manufacturing operators and supervisors require efficient data manipulation tools that can handle high-volume inventory operations while maintaining responsiveness and providing contextual actions for inventory management tasks.

### Solution
Replace the standard DataGrid with a high-performance, custom ItemsRepeater-based control that provides superior performance, extensive customization capabilities, and consistent user experience across all inventory management views. The solution includes configurable column management, persistent user preferences, advanced selection mechanisms, contextual row actions, and integrated sorting/filtering capabilities.

### Impact
**Expected Outcomes:**
- **Performance:** 75% reduction in data loading and rendering time for large datasets
- **User Productivity:** 40% decrease in time spent on inventory data manipulation tasks
- **User Satisfaction:** Improved workflow efficiency through personalized grid configurations
- **Operational Efficiency:** Reduced training time for new users through consistent interface patterns
- **System Scalability:** Support for datasets 5x larger than current capacity

**And** SelectedItems collection is properly bound to ViewModel

### Row Actions (US-004, US-005)
**Given** an Inventory Clerk needs to delete an inventory item  
**When** delete functionality is enabled for the grid  
**Then** a trash icon button appears on the right side of each row  
**And** clicking the trash icon triggers the delete command  
**And** right-clicking any row shows a context menu with available actions  
**And** actions are enabled/disabled based on current selection and user privileges

### Column Customization (US-006, US-007, US-008)

**When** they access the column management interface  
**Then** they can toggle column visibility with immediate effect  
**And** they can drag column headers to reorder columns  
**And** they can resize column widths by dragging column borders  
**And** all customizations are saved and restored in future sessions  
**And** settings are isolated per view (RemoveTabView vs TransferTabView)

### Sorting Capabilities (US-009)
**Given** a Quality Control Specialist needs to sort inventory data  
**When** they click on a column header  
**Then** data sorts by that column in ascending order  
**And** clicking again sorts in descending order  
**And** clicking a third time removes sorting  
**And** sort direction indicators (arrows) are displayed in headers  
**And** Ctrl+click enables multi-column sorting with priority indicators

### Filtering Functionality (US-010)
**Given** an Inventory Clerk needs to filter inventory items  
**When** they access column filter options  
**Then** they can apply text filters to string columns  
**And** they can apply range filters to numeric columns  
**And** they can apply date range filters to date columns  
**And** filter indicators are displayed on filtered columns  
**And** filtered results update immediately

### Visual Highlighting (US-011, US-012)
**Given** inventory items with different status conditions  
**When** the grid displays the data  
**Then** low-quantity items (< 10) are highlighted in yellow  
**And** expired items are highlighted in red  
**And** items requiring attention are highlighted according to business rules  
**And** highlighting rules can be configured per implementation  
**And** color scheme respects current theme settings

### Settings Panel (US-013, US-014)

**Given** a Production Manager needs to export inventory data  
**When** they select export functionality  
**Then** they can choose which columns to include  
**And** they can select CSV, Excel, or PDF format  
**And** they can choose to export all data or only selected/filtered items  
**And** export includes proper headers and formatting  
**And** large exports show progress indication

## Out of Scope

### Explicitly Excluded from This Feature

#### Data Management
- **Real-time data synchronization** - Data refresh will be handled by parent ViewModels
- **Database CRUD operations** - Grid is display-only; actions will be handled by existing services
- **Data validation and business rules** - Validation remains responsibility of business layer
- **Offline data caching** - Data management stays with existing service layer

#### Advanced Analytics
- **Chart and graph generation** - Separate reporting features will handle visualization
- **Statistical analysis tools** - Advanced analytics belong in dedicated reporting modules
- **Data trend analysis** - Historical analysis is separate feature
- **Predictive modeling** - Machine learning features are separate initiative

#### Integration Features
- **Email integration for exports** - Email functionality is separate service
- **Direct printer integration** - Printing will use system print dialogs
- **External API connectivity** - Data integration remains in service layer
- **Barcode/QR code scanning** - Input features are separate from display grid

#### Advanced User Management
- **Role-based column security** - Basic privilege checking only; detailed security is separate
- **User activity auditing** - Audit trails are handled by business layer
- **Multi-tenant data isolation** - Tenant management is application-level concern
- **Advanced permission management** - Complex permissions are separate feature

#### Mobile and Cross-Platform
- **Mobile-responsive design** - This is desktop-focused Avalonia control
- **Touch gesture support** - Mouse and keyboard interaction only
- **Cross-platform compatibility testing** - Will follow standard Avalonia patterns
- **Tablet optimization** - Desktop interface patterns only

#### Performance Extremes
- **Real-time data streaming** - Static data display with manual refresh
- **Infinite scrolling** - Virtual scrolling with defined boundaries
- **Background data processing** - Processing remains in business layer
- **Distributed data handling** - Single data source per grid instance

### Future Considerations (Not in Current Scope)
- Advanced grid themes and styling beyond MTM design system
- Integration with external BI tools
- Advanced keyboard shortcuts beyond standard navigation
- Collaborative features (shared settings, comments)
- Advanced accessibility features beyond standard requirements
- Localization beyond basic date/number formatting
