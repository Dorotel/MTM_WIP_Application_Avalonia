# MTM Audit System Example: Print Service Analysis

This directory contains a real-world example of the MTM Audit System analyzing the Print Service implementation. Use these files as templates for analyzing other features.

## Example Files

### Gap Report Example
- `print-service-gap-report-example.md` - Complete gap analysis for Print Service
- Shows real implementation status, missing files, and priority ordering
- Demonstrates MTM pattern compliance checking
- Includes actionable next steps and time estimates

### Copilot Prompt Example  
- `print-service-copilot-prompt-example.md` - Ready-to-use Copilot continuation prompt
- Generated from gap report analysis
- Includes critical context and implementation priorities
- Shows proper MTM pattern examples and compliance checks

## How This Example Was Generated

1. **Gap Analysis Phase**: Audit system analyzed Print Service implementation plan against current PR state
2. **Pattern Compliance Check**: Verified adherence to MTM MVVM, Avalonia, and service patterns
3. **Priority Assessment**: Identified critical blockers vs. enhancement items
4. **Context Generation**: Created developer-friendly continuation prompt with examples

## Using This Example

### For Print Service Development
1. Copy content from `print-service-copilot-prompt-example.md`
2. Paste into GitHub issue with `#github-pull-request_copilot-coding-agent` hashtag
3. Copilot will implement missing components following MTM patterns

### For Other Features
1. Use these files as templates for structure and content style
2. Replace Print Service specific details with your feature information
3. Follow the same gap analysis → priority ordering → implementation pattern approach
4. Maintain the same level of detail for MTM pattern compliance checking

## Key Benefits Demonstrated

- **Consistency**: All implementations follow established MTM patterns
- **Efficiency**: Developers get targeted, actionable guidance
- **Quality**: Comprehensive compliance checking prevents pattern violations
- **Continuity**: Rich context enables seamless multi-session development

## Template Customization Points

When adapting for other features, customize:
- Feature name and description
- File paths and component lists
- Specific business logic and requirements
- Database procedures and integration points
- UI layout and navigation patterns

The core structure, pattern compliance checking, and priority methodology remain consistent across all MTM features.
