# Needs Repair - Code Quality Assurance System

## Overview
This instruction file serves as a **quality assurance system guideline** for identifying code that does not meet the standards defined in the MTM WIP Application instruction files. When Copilot is asked to verify code compliance, it will generate **standalone compliance reports** in dedicated files rather than populating this instruction file.

## Purpose
- **Code Standards Verification**: Track files that don't comply with instruction guidelines
- **Standalone Report Generation**: Create individual compliance reports for each audit
- **Quality Assurance Documentation**: Maintain audit trail with dated reports
- **Compliance Tracking**: Monitor progress on bringing code up to standards
- **Instruction File Adherence**: Ensure all code follows established patterns and conventions

---

## Compliance Report System

### **Report Generation Guidelines**

When conducting code compliance verification, **DO NOT** populate this file with findings. Instead:

1. **Create standalone report files** in the `Compliance Reports/` folder
2. **Use standardized naming**: `{FileName}-compliance-report-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`
3. **Generate custom fix prompt** at the end of each report
4. **Maintain audit trail** with timestamped reports

### **Report Directory Structure**
```
Compliance Reports/
??? Services/
?   ??? InventoryService-compliance-report-2025-01-27.md
??? ViewModels/
?   ??? MainViewModel-compliance-report-2025-01-27.md
??? Views/
?   ??? MainView-compliance-report-2025-01-27.md
??? Summary/
    ??? project-compliance-summary-2025-01-27.md
```

### **Standalone Report Template**

Each compliance report should be a separate markdown file with this structure:

```markdown
# Compliance Report: {FileName}

**Review Date**: {YYYY-MM-DD}  
**Reviewed By**: Quality Assurance Auditor Copilot  
**File Path**: {RelativeFilePath}  
**Instruction Files Referenced**: {List of .instruction.md files}  
**Compliance Status**: ? **CRITICAL** / ?? **NEEDS REPAIR** / ? **COMPLIANT**

## Custom Fix Prompt

**Use this prompt to implement the fixes identified in this report:**

```
Fix compliance violations in {FileName} based on the findings in Compliance Reports/{ReportFileName}.

Implement the following fixes in priority order:
1. {High priority fix 1}
2. {High priority fix 2}
3. {Medium priority fixes as applicable}

Follow these MTM patterns:
- {Pattern 1}
- {Pattern 2}

Reference these instruction files:
- {instruction-file-1.md}
- {instruction-file-2.md}

Ensure all changes maintain existing functionality while bringing code into compliance with MTM standards.
After implementation, run build verification to confirm no compilation errors.

## Quality Assurance Workflow

### **Step 1: Compliance Audit**
1. Run compliance verification prompt on target files
2. Copilot generates standalone report in `Compliance Reports/` folder
3. Report includes specific violations and fix guidance

### **Step 2: Report Review**
1. Review generated compliance report
2. Prioritize fixes based on report recommendations
3. Plan implementation using provided custom prompt

### **Step 3: Fix Implementation**
1. Use custom prompt from report to implement fixes
2. Address critical and high-priority violations first
3. Apply recommended patterns and standards

### **Step 4: Re-verification**
1. Generate new compliance report on updated code
2. Compare with previous report to track progress
3. Update compliance status and document improvements

### **Step 5: Compliance Tracking**
1. Maintain audit trail with dated reports
2. Track compliance metrics over time
3. Monitor overall project compliance health

## Custom Prompt for Quality Verification

### **Generate Compliance Report**
**Persona:** Quality Assurance Auditor Copilot  
*(See [personas-instruction.md](personas-instruction.md) for role details)*

**Prompt:**  
"Conduct comprehensive compliance audit of {filename} against all MTM WIP Application instruction guidelines. Generate a standalone compliance report in Compliance Reports/{filename}-compliance-report-{date}.md identifying violations of naming conventions, UI generation standards, ReactiveUI patterns, MTM data patterns, color scheme requirements, architecture guidelines, error handling standards, and layout/design principles. Include specific code examples, priority classifications, and a custom fix prompt at the end of the report."

**Usage Example:**  
```
Conduct comprehensive compliance audit of Services/InventoryService.cs against all MTM WIP Application instruction guidelines. Generate a standalone compliance report in Compliance Reports/Services/InventoryService-compliance-report-2025-01-27.md with detailed findings and custom fix prompt.
```

**Bulk Assessment Example:**  
```
Conduct comprehensive quality audit of MTM_WIP_Application_Avalonia project. Review all C# and AXAML files for MTM compliance. Generate individual compliance reports in Compliance Reports/ folder organized by directory structure. Include project-wide compliance summary report with metrics and recommendations.
```

**Re-verification Example:**  
```
Re-audit {filename} for compliance improvements and generate updated compliance report. Compare findings with previous report from Compliance Reports/ and document progress made on fixing violations. Update compliance status and metrics.
```
