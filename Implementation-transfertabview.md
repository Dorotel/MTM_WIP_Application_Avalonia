# Transfer Tab UI/UX Enhancement Implementation Plan

## Goal

Redesign and refactor the Transfer Tab interface to provide a more intuitive user experience with proper validation, layout optimization, and complete feature functionality. The enhancement will move critical input controls out of collapsible panels, implement proper transfer logic with partial quantity support, and ensure seamless integration with the existing MTM manufacturing workflow.

## Requirements

- **UI Layout Redesign**: Move Location and Quantity inputs from collapsible panel to always-visible card below TransferCustomDataGrid
- **Enhanced Validation**: Implement proper transfer button validation (Row Selected, Location entered, Quantity <= selected row quantity)
- **Partial Transfer Support**: Enable transfers of partial quantities with automatic inventory adjustment
- **Edit Functionality**: Ensure Edit button works consistently with CustomDataGrid patterns
- **Form State Management**: Implement proper field reset behavior (only on Reset button or tab switching)
- **Transaction Integration**: Use existing stored procedures with "TRANSFER" transaction type
- **User Experience**: Optimize layout for all elements to fit properly without overflow

## Technical Considerations

        A[TransferTabView.axaml] --> B[TransferCustomDataGrid.axaml]
        A --> C[Location/Quantity Card]
        A --> D[Transfer Controls]
    end
    
    subgraph "ViewModel Layer"
        E[TransferItemViewModel] --> F[Transfer Validation Logic]
        E --> G[Inventory Search Logic]
        E --> H[UI State Management]
    end
    
    subgraph "Service Layer"
        I[DatabaseService] --> J[Transfer Stored Procedures]
        I --> K[Inventory Update Procedures]
        L[MasterDataService] --> M[Location/Part Data]
    end
    
    subgraph "Data Layer"
        N[(MySQL Database)] --> O[inv_inventory_Transfer]
        N --> P[inv_inventory_Update_Quantity]

    end
    
    A --> E
    E --> I
    E --> L
    B --> E
    F --> I
```

### Database Schema Integration

The feature will leverage existing MTM database procedures:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    INVENTORY ||--o{ TRANSACTIONS : "generates"
    INVENTORY {
        string PartID
        string Operation
        string Location
        int Quantity
        datetime LastUpdated
        string Notes
    }
    TRANSACTIONS {
        int TransactionID
        string PartID
        string Operation
        string FromLocation
        string ToLocation
        int Quantity
        string TransactionType
        string User
        datetime TransactionDate
        string Notes
    }
```

### API Design

**Transfer Operations:**

- `ExecuteTransferAsync()` - Main transfer logic with validation
- `UpdatePartialInventoryAsync()` - Handle partial quantity transfers
- `ValidateTransferRequest()` - Pre-transfer validation
- `ResetTransferForm()` - Form state management

**Validation Rules:**

- Selected inventory item required
- Destination location must be different from source
- Transfer quantity must be > 0 and <= available quantity
- User must be authenticated

### Frontend Architecture

**Component Hierarchy:**

```
TransferTabView
├── Search Configuration Panel (CollapsiblePanel)
│   ├── Part Selection (AutoCompleteBox)
│   └── Operation Selection (AutoCompleteBox)
├── Transfer Data Grid (TransferCustomDataGrid)
│   ├── Inventory Display Columns
│   ├── Transfer Arrow Column
│   └── Action Buttons (Transfer, Edit)
├── Transfer Controls Card (New - Always Visible)
│   ├── Destination Location (AutoCompleteBox)
│   ├── Transfer Quantity (TextBox with validation)
│   └── Validation Messages
└── Action Buttons Panel
    ├── Transfer Button (Primary)
    ├── Reset Button (Secondary)
    └── Print Button (Secondary)
```

**State Management Patterns:**

- MVVM Community Toolkit with `[ObservableProperty]` attributes
- Validation attributes for input validation
- Command patterns with proper `CanExecute` logic
- Event-driven updates for inventory refresh

### Security Performance

**Input Validation:**

- Server-side validation for all transfer parameters
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- Business rule validation (location existence, quantity limits)

**Performance Optimization:**

- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- UI virtualization for large inventory datasets
- Debounced search operations
- Cached master data (locations, operations)

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: UI Layout Restructuring

1. **Extract Location/Quantity Controls**: Move from CollapsiblePanel to dedicated card
2. **Responsive Layout Design**: Ensure proper spacing and overflow handling
3. **Visual Consistency**: Apply MTM design system styling
4. **Accessibility**: Implement proper tab order and keyboard navigation

### Phase 2: Transfer Logic Implementation

1. **Validation Enhancement**: Implement comprehensive transfer validation
2. **Partial Transfer Logic**: Handle quantity splitting and inventory updates
3. **Transaction Integration**: Connect to existing stored procedures
4. **Error Handling**: Centralized error management with user feedback

### Phase 3: Form State Management

1. **Reset Behavior**: Implement proper field clearing logic
2. **Tab Switching**: Handle form state during navigation
3. **Data Persistence**: Maintain search results during operations
4. **User Experience**: Smooth interactions and feedback

### Phase 4: Integration Testing

1. **Database Operations**: Verify stored procedure integration
2. **UI Responsiveness**: Test layout across different screen sizes
3. **User Workflows**: End-to-end transfer operation testing
4. **Error Scenarios**: Validate error handling and recovery

## Success Criteria
