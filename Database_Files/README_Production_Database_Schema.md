# Production Database Schema

**Status**: Production Ready  
**Environment**: Production  
**Last Updated**: [To be updated during deployment]

## Overview
This file contains the complete production database schema for the MTM WIP Application. This schema represents the current state of the production database.

## ?? READ-ONLY FILE
**This file is READ-ONLY and represents the current production state.**

For schema modifications:
1. Make changes in `Development/Database_Files/Development_Database_Schema.sql`
2. Test thoroughly in development environment
3. Deploy to production through proper change management process

## Schema Components

### Core Tables
- **inventory** - Main inventory tracking table
- **transactions** - Inventory transaction history
- **parts** - Part master data
- **operations** - Manufacturing operation definitions
- **locations** - Storage location definitions
- **users** - User management and authentication

### Supporting Tables
- **audit_log** - System audit trail
- **error_log** - Application error tracking
- **configuration** - System configuration settings
- **user_sessions** - User session management

### Indexes
- Primary keys on all tables
- Foreign key relationships with referential integrity
- Performance indexes on frequently queried columns
- Composite indexes for complex query patterns

### Constraints
- Data validation constraints
- Foreign key constraints
- Check constraints for business rules
- Unique constraints for data integrity

## Security Features

### Access Control
- Role-based access through stored procedures
- User permission validation
- Audit logging for all data modifications

### Data Protection
- Sensitive data encryption
- Parameter validation to prevent SQL injection
- Error message sanitization

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Features
- Proper indexing strategy
- Query execution plan optimization
- Connection pooling configuration
- Memory usage optimization

### Monitoring
- Performance metrics collection
- Slow query identification
- Resource usage tracking

## Backup and Recovery

### Backup Strategy
- Daily full backups
- Transaction log backups every 15 minutes
- Point-in-time recovery capability
- Backup verification and testing

### Disaster Recovery
- High availability configuration
- Failover procedures
- Data replication setup
- Recovery time objectives (RTO/RPO)

## Dependencies

### External Systems
- Authentication service integration
- Reporting system connections
- Third-party data feeds

### Internal Dependencies
- Application connection strings
- Stored procedure dependencies
- View and function relationships

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Index maintenance and rebuilding
- Statistics updates
- Backup verification
- Performance monitoring

### Scheduled Operations
- Data archiving procedures
- Cleanup operations
- Maintenance window activities

## Change Management

### Deployment Process
1. Development testing in `Development/Database_Files/`
2. Staging environment validation
3. Production deployment approval
4. Rollback plan preparation
5. Post-deployment verification

### Version Control
- Schema version tracking
- Change documentation
- Rollback procedures
- Impact analysis
