# Action Specification: TransferTabView Cleanup and Implementation

Feature Branch: 002-complete-transfertabview-axaml  
Created: September 28, 2025  
Status: Ready for Implementation  
Input: Analysis of current TransferTabView implementation against specification requirements with identification of unused features and missing implementation details

---

## File Backup and Full Redesign Mandate

- Both files will be renamed to backups:
  - #file:TransferTabView.axaml → TransferTabView.axaml.backup
  - #file:TransferTabView.axaml.cs → TransferTabView.axaml.cs.backup
- The new TransferTabView.axaml and TransferTabView.axaml.cs will be redesigned and recreated from scratch.
- Backup files are ONLY for reference. No direct copy-forward; structure, layout, and wiring must be re-authored.
- All existing UI elements and behaviors must still exist functionally in the remake (search fields, destination field, actions, DataGrid with column customization, edit overlay, loading and empty states, key bindings), but the design/layout must not replicate the backup.
- The remake must adopt the mandatory MTM tab pattern (ScrollViewer root, Grid RowDefinitions="*,Auto", theme DynamicResource usage).
- All UI element sizing must use #file:ResolutionIndependentSizingService.cs:
  - Use service-derived values for control heights, font sizes, padding, and touch target sizes.
  - Avoid hardcoded pixel values for these aspects. Expose service values as local resources or bindings set during view initialization.
  - Integration pattern: resolve IResolutionIndependentSizingService in code-behind via DI (consistent with existing service-resolution pattern in views), populate locally-scoped resources (e.g., TransferView.ControlHeight, TransferView.FontSize, TransferView.Padding), and reference them in AXAML.

## Execution Flow (main)

```bash
1. Analyze current TransferTabView implementation against specification ✓
    → Current implementation exceeds original requirements significantly
2. Identify architectural over-engineering and unused features ✓
    → 15 major unused features identified across methods, properties, and classes
3. Compare implementation with specification task completion ✓
    → 35 of 36 specification tasks complete (99.9% completion rate)
4. Assess risk levels for cleanup and implementation phases ✓
    → Both phases assessed as VERY LOW risk with high value
5. Generate action recommendations for optimization ✓
    → Two-phase approach prioritizing cleanup before implementation
6. Validate completion criteria and effort estimation ✓
    → Production-ready state achievable with minimal effort
7. Return: SUCCESS (action plan ready for execution) ✓
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines

- Focus on WHAT needs to be removed and WHY: Architectural cleanup improves maintainability.
- Identify WHAT remains incomplete and HOW to finish: Single TODO item resolution.
- Redesign from scratch: All functional elements preserved, design/layout re-authored to MTM patterns.
- All sizing must flow through ResolutionIndependentSizingService (no hardcoded dimensions for core sizing).

### Architectural Over-Engineering Identification

Unused Methods (3): Tab switching logic, programmatic search trigger, sample data loaders.  
Unused Properties (5): Multi-selection store, obsolete panel flags, legacy computed props.  
Unused Event Handlers (4): CollapsiblePanel hooks for non-existent controls.  
Unused Classes: Internal result types unused by current approach.  
Code-Behind Inconsistencies: Service-provider constructor and control references for absent elements.

## Action Requirements

### User Interface Design Requirements

- UI-001: Implement transfer destination selection in TransferTabView main interface using SuggestionOverlayView pattern (EditInventoryView Location is read-only).
- UI-002: Match InventoryTabView location selection UX and patterns.
- UI-003: Provide destination location selection in the main interface via SuggestionOverlayView.
- UI-004: Workflow: Search → Select items → Specify destination → Execute transfer.
- UI-005: Reuse InventoryTabView SuggestionOverlayView positioning and master data integration patterns.
- UI-006: Redesign from scratch while preserving all functional UI elements and behaviors.

### Cleanup Phase Requirements

- CR-001..CR-007: Remove all unused code, properties, events, and classes; preserve MVVM Toolkit patterns and existing functionality.
- CR-008: Remove code-behind references to controls not present in the new design; rewire only existing elements post-redesign.

### Implementation Phase Requirements

- IR-001..IR-006: Connect IColumnConfigurationService to ViewModel, apply and persist column visibility, handle errors, complete TODO at line 1561.

### Transfer Location Design Requirements

- TL-001..TL-006: Add and validate destination location via SuggestionOverlayView in main interface; must differ from source location(s); align UX with InventoryTabView.

### Transfer Workflow Implementation Requirements

- TW-001..TW-009: Add destination field in action panel, integrate SuggestionOverlayView (autocomplete, wildcard %, “Did you mean?”), validate before enabling Transfer, maintain EditInventoryView for details.

### SuggestionOverlayView Integration Requirements

- SO-001..SO-010: Implement destination SuggestionOverlayView identical to InventoryTabView for data, filtering, keyboard nav, positioning, styling, and lifecycle.

### Sizing & Layout Requirements (New)

- SZ-001: All core sizing must use ResolutionIndependentSizingService (font size, control height, padding, touch target).
- SZ-002: Resolve IResolutionIndependentSizingService via DI in code-behind; expose values as local resources (e.g., TransferView.FontSize, TransferView.ControlHeight, TransferView.Padding, TransferView.TouchTarget).
- SZ-003: Reference these resources throughout AXAML; avoid hardcoded pixel values for these aspects.
- SZ-004: Adopt mandatory tab layout pattern for MainView tabs:
  - Root ScrollViewer, Grid RowDefinitions="*,Auto", card-based layout, dynamic resources for colors, containment and clipping.

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 0: Backup + Full Redesign (MANDATORY)

- Rename files to .backup (AXAML and .cs).  
- Recreate TransferTabView.axaml and .cs from scratch:
  - Implement mandatory tab pattern (ScrollViewer root; Grid RowDefinitions="*,Auto").
  - Re-author layout so it is not the same design; preserve all functional elements:
    - PartTextBox, OperationTextBox, Destination Location TextBox (SuggestionOverlayView), Search/Reset, DataGrid with column customization Flyout, Transfer/Edit actions, Loading, Empty state, KeyBindings, Edit overlay.
  - Resolve IResolutionIndependentSizingService and populate local resources for sizing; apply across UI.

Success Criteria: Clean compile; functional parity; new design; sizing via service.

### Phase 1: Architectural Cleanup

Objective: Remove over-engineered/unused code.  
Scope: Remove 15 identified unused features.  
Success Criteria: Clean build; no regressions.

### Phase 2: SuggestionOverlayView Integration and Transfer Workflow Completion

Objective: Implement destination selection in main interface (SuggestionOverlayView).  
Scope: Destination field with validation, keyboard nav, overlay positioning, UX parity with InventoryTabView.  
Success Criteria: Users can specify destination and transfer successfully.

### Phase 3: Column Preference Implementation

Objective: Persist column preferences via IColumnConfigurationService.  
Scope: Load, apply to AvailableColumns, persist on changes, handle errors.
