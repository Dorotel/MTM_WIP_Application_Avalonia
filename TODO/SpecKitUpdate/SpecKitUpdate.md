# Complete GitHub Spec Commands (GSC) Enhancement System with Memory Integration

## Problem Statement

Implement a comprehensive enhancement to the existing GSC system (/constitution, /specify, /clarify, /plan, /task, /analyze, /implement) that includes memory file integration from `C:\Users\johnk\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\prompts`, cross-platform compatibility with @github/spec-kit, enhanced PowerShell validation scripts, new GSC commands, and robust dependency management for manufacturing-grade development workflows.

## System Architecture Requirements

### A. Memory File Integration System

Create memory file reading and integration capabilities:

**Memory File Locations**:

- `C:\Users\johnk\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\prompts\avalonia-ui-memory.instructions.md`
- `C:\Users\johnk\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\prompts\debugging-memory.instructions.md`
- `C:\Users\johnk\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\prompts\memory.instructions.md`
- `C:\Users\johnk\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\prompts\avalonia-custom-controls-memory.instructions.md`

**Integration Points**:

- `/constitution` - Reads all memory files for complete context
- `/specify` - Integrates Avalonia UI patterns and custom control memory
- `/clarify` - Uses debugging workflows and systematic problem-solving

  constitution: 
    description: "Validate constitutional compliance with memory integration"
    script: ".specify/scripts/gsc-constitution.sh"
  specify:
    description: "Create feature specification with Avalonia UI memory patterns"
    script: ".specify/scripts/gsc-specify.sh"
  # ... additional commands
```

### E. State Management and Orchestration

#### Master Orchestration Script (`.specify/scripts/gsc-orchestrator.ps1`)

```powershell
# Manage complete GSC workflow execution
# Track state across command boundaries
# Integrate memory file reading at appropriate stages
# Provide rollback and recovery capabilities
# Support parallel execution where marked [P]
# Generate comprehensive workflow reports
```

#### State Files

- `.specify/state/gsc-workflow.json` - Tracks workflow progress and memory integration
- `.specify/state/validation-status.json` - Tracks validation results with memory context
- `.specify/state/constitutional-compliance.json` - Tracks compliance with memory patterns
- `.specify/state/memory-integration.json` - Tracks which memory patterns were applied when

### F. Enhanced Templates with Memory Integration

#### Updated Templates

- `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` - Include memory pattern checkpoints
- `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` - Integrate Avalonia UI memory requirements
- `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` - Include custom control development patterns
- `.specify/templates/gsc-command-template.ps1` - Standard template for new GSC commands

### G. File Structure Implementation

## Manufacturing Domain Considerations

- All enhancements must support 24/7 manufacturing operations
- Memory integration must not impact development workflow performance
- Cross-platform compatibility required for diverse manufacturing environments
- GSC commands must be executable by manufacturing operators with minimal training
- Error messages must be actionable using memory-driven troubleshooting guides
- State management must support shift handoffs and multi-user environments

This comprehensive implementation will transform the GSC system into a memory-driven, cross-platform, manufacturing-grade development workflow that leverages accumulated knowledge while maintaining constitutional compliance and spec-kit integration.
