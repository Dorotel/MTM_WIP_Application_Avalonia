# Tasks: 100% Fully Developed Constitution.md File

**Input**: Design documents- [x] T026: Constitutional compliance unit tests in tests/constitutional-compliance/test-principle-validation.md

- [x] T027: Manufacturing domain rule validation tests in tests/constitutional-compliance/test-manufacturing-domain.md

- [x] T033: Final constitutional governance system validation and deployment readinessspecs/001-100-fully-developed/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Tech stack: Markdown documentation, Git, CI/CD pipeline
   → Structure: Documentation-focused governance
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: Constitutional entities (4 core principles, QA standards, etc.)
   → contracts/: Constitutional compliance contract
   → research.md: Constitutional framework decisions
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Constitution structure, CI/CD integration, documentation
   → Tests: Constitutional compliance validation, contract tests
   → Core: Constitution content, governance processes, validation rules
   → Integration: GitHub workflow, .github/instructions integration
   → Polish: Documentation validation, cross-platform testing
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Constitution documentation structure with CI/CD integration and GitHub workflows.

## Phase 3.1: Setup

- [x] T001 Create constitutional document structure at repository root `constitution.md`
- [x] T002 Initialize CI/CD pipeline structure in `.github/workflows/constitution-compliance.yml`
- [x] T003 [P] Configure constitutional validation scripts in `.specify/scripts/validate-constitution.ps1`

## Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3

**CRITICAL: These tests MUST be written and MUST FAIL before ANY implementation**

## Phase 3.5: Polish

- [ ] T026 [P] Constitutional compliance unit tests in `tests/constitutional-compliance/test-principle-validation.md`
- [ ] T027 [P] Manufacturing domain rule validation tests in `tests/constitutional-compliance/test-manufacturing-domain.md`
- [ ] T028 [P] Cross-platform constitutional consistency tests in `tests/constitutional-compliance/test-cross-platform-consistency.md`
- [x] T029: Update repository README.md with constitutional governance overview
- [x] T030: Create constitutional governance quickstart guide validation in docs/quickstart-validation.md
- [ ] T031 [P] Update repository README.md with constitutional governance overview
- [ ] T032 [P] Create constitutional governance quickstart guide validation in `docs/quickstart-validation.md`
- [ ] T033 Execute quickstart.md validation scenarios end-to-end

## Dependencies

**Setup Phase**: T001-T003 must complete first
**Tests Phase**: T004-T009 before any implementation (T010-T019)
**Core Implementation Dependencies**:

- T010-T013 (Core Principles) before T014-T016 (Standards/Governance)
- T017-T019 (Authority/Process) after T016 (Governance Framework)
**Integration Dependencies**:
- T020-T022 (CI/CD) after T010-T019 (Core Implementation)
- T023-T025 (Library Integration) after T020-T022 (CI/CD)
**Polish Phase**: T026-T033 after all core and integration tasks

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Phase 3.2: Parallel Test Creation

```bash
# Launch T004-T009 together (different test files):
Task: "Contract test for amendment process validation in tests/constitutional-compliance/test-amendment-process.md"
Task: "Contract test for compliance check validation in tests/constitutional-compliance/test-compliance-validation.md"
Task: "Contract test for performance monitoring in tests/constitutional-compliance/test-performance-monitoring.md"
Task: "Integration test for Repository Owner + @Agent approval in tests/constitutional-compliance/test-dual-approval-workflow.md"
Task: "Integration test for principle conflict resolution in tests/constitutional-compliance/test-conflict-resolution.md"
Task: "Integration test for 30-day legacy compliance in tests/constitutional-compliance/test-legacy-compliance.md"
```

### Phase 3.3: Parallel Core Principle Implementation

```bash
# Launch T010-T013 together (different sections of constitution.md):
Task: "Core Principle I: Code Quality Excellence in constitution.md section I"
Task: "Core Principle II: Comprehensive Testing Standards in constitution.md section II" 
Task: "Core Principle III: User Experience Consistency in constitution.md section III"
Task: "Core Principle IV: Performance Requirements in constitution.md section IV"
```

### Phase 3.5: Parallel Polish Tasks

```bash
# Launch T026-T028, T031-T032 together (different files):
Task: "Constitutional compliance unit tests in tests/constitutional-compliance/test-principle-validation.md"
Task: "Manufacturing domain rule validation tests in tests/constitutional-compliance/test-manufacturing-domain.md"
Task: "Cross-platform consistency tests in tests/constitutional-compliance/test-cross-platform-consistency.md"
Task: "Update repository README.md with constitutional governance overview"
Task: "Create constitutional governance quickstart guide validation in docs/quickstart-validation.md"
```

## Task Generation Rules Applied

1. **From Contracts**: constitutional-compliance.md → T004-T006 contract tests [P]
2. **From Data Model**: 4 entities (Core Principles, QA Standards, Performance Standards, Governance Framework) → T010-T016 model tasks
3. **From User Stories**: Amendment process, compliance validation, conflict resolution → T007-T009 integration tests [P]
4. **From Quickstart**: Validation scenarios → T033 end-to-end validation

## Validation Checklist

- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests (T004-T006)
- [x] All entities have implementation tasks (T010-T016)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (T004-T009 before T010-T019)
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (different files/sections)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] Constitutional authority and governance processes implemented
- [x] Repository Owner + @Agent approval workflow established
- [x] 30-day compliance timeline enforced
- [x] Manufacturing domain integration validated
- [x] Cross-platform consistency maintained

## Notes

- [P] tasks target different files or independent sections
- Constitutional tests must fail before implementation begins
- Repository Owner and @Agent approval required for constitutional amendments
- All tasks align with manufacturing domain requirements and zero-tolerance reliability standards
- Constitutional governance supersedes all other development practices
- @Agent-optimized development enables 30-day compliance timeline
- Cross-platform validation ensures consistency across Windows/macOS/Linux/Android
- Manufacturing context integrated throughout (operations 90/100/110/120, location codes, etc.)
