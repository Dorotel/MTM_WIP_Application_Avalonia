## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Feature: Create comprehensive constitutional governance document
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: Development team, project stakeholders, code reviewers
   → Actions: Define principles, establish standards, govern development
   → Data: Development standards, quality gates, governance rules
   → Constraints: Manufacturing domain requirements, enterprise standards
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → All aspects clearly defined from existing constitution.md
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → User flow: Development governance and compliance validation
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement testable against development practices
6. Identify Key Entities (governance structures)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → Spec complete and unambiguous
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-27

- Q: Who has the authority to initiate and approve constitutional amendments? → A: Repository Owner and @Agent
- Q: How should conflicts between constitutional principles be resolved when they contradict each other? → A: Code Quality > UX > Performance > Testing
- Q: What specific aspects of development should be explicitly excluded from constitutional governance? → A: Use your best discretion. As long as it is not App-Breaking, be flexible
- Q: How frequently should constitutional compliance be automatically verified in the development workflow? → A: Pull request creation only (gate-based)
- Q: What should be the maximum timeframe allowed for bringing legacy code into constitutional compliance? → A: 30 days (immediate compliance)

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a **development team member**, I need a comprehensive constitutional governance document that defines non-negotiable development standards, quality assurance requirements, and performance benchmarks so that all MTM WIP Application development maintains enterprise manufacturing-grade reliability and consistency across all team members and development phases.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a new developer joining the project, **When** they review the constitution.md file, **Then** they understand all non-negotiable development standards and can begin contributing code that meets constitutional requirements without additional guidance.

2. **Given** a code review process, **When** reviewers use the constitutional checklist, **Then** all pull requests are consistently evaluated against the same enterprise standards regardless of reviewer.

3. **Given** a cross-platform deployment requirement, **When** following constitutional performance standards, **Then** the application meets operational demands on Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android platforms.

4. **Given** a manufacturing environment deployment, **When** constitutional principles are followed, **Then** the system achieves zero-tolerance reliability requirements for continuous manufacturing operations.

5. **Given** a constitutional amendment requirement, **When** following the formal amendment process, **Then** changes are implemented with full impact assessment and migration planning without breaking existing development workflows.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when constitutional principles conflict with rapid development timelines? (Constitution supersedes timeline pressure with documented rationale)
- How does the system handle amendments to constitutional requirements? (Formal amendment process with impact assessment and stakeholder approval required)
- What occurs when legacy code doesn't meet new constitutional standards? (Migration plan required with 30-day compliance timeline and verification, optimized for @Agent-based development)
- How are constitutional violations detected and remediated? (Automated CI/CD pipeline checks with mandatory resolution before merge)
- How are conflicts between constitutional principles resolved? (Fixed hierarchy: Code Quality > UX > Performance > Testing)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Core Constitutional Structure

- **FR-001**: Constitution MUST define four non-negotiable core principles covering code quality excellence, comprehensive testing standards, user experience consistency, and performance requirements with manufacturing-specific rationale for each principle
- **FR-002**: Constitution MUST establish enterprise manufacturing standards including .NET 8.0 with nullable reference types, MVVM Community Toolkit patterns exclusively, dependency injection with Microsoft.Extensions, and centralized error handling
- **FR-003**: Constitution MUST require 5-tier testing framework including unit tests, integration tests, UI automation tests, cross-platform feature tests, and end-to-end manufacturing operator workflow tests
- **FR-003A**: Constitution MUST explicitly exclude non-app-breaking development practices from governance, allowing flexible discretion for personal preferences, experimental approaches, and individual workflow tools

#### Quality Assurance Framework  

- **FR-004**: Constitution MUST establish comprehensive quality assurance standards with automated build validation, unit test coverage above 80%, integration test validation, UI automation test verification, and cross-platform compatibility confirmation
- **FR-005**: Constitution MUST define manufacturing domain validation requirements including valid operations compliance, location codes verification, transaction type validation, part ID format consistency, and session timeout enforcement
- **FR-006**: Constitution MUST specify code review requirements with security analysis, performance impact assessment, and manufacturing domain rule validation

#### Performance Standards

- **FR-007**: Constitution MUST define measurable performance benchmarks including database operations under 30 seconds timeout, UI responsiveness maintenance during concurrent operations, memory usage optimization for 8+ hour sessions, and startup time under 10 seconds
- **FR-008**: Constitution MUST establish monitoring and observability requirements including structured logging with correlation IDs, performance metrics collection, error rate monitoring, and manufacturing operator workflow analytics
- **FR-009**: Constitution MUST specify cross-platform performance consistency within 5% variance and database connection pool health monitoring for MySQL 5-100 connections

#### Governance Framework

- **FR-010**: Constitution MUST provide governance structure with constitutional authority superseding all other development practices, formal amendment process requiring business justification and impact assessment with Repository Owner and @Agent approval authority, and compliance verification for all pull requests
- **FR-011**: Constitution MUST integrate with existing .github/instructions/ library while maintaining ultimate authority over development practices and providing runtime guidance through .github/copilot-instructions.md
- **FR-012**: Constitution MUST establish automated constitution checking in CI/CD pipeline triggered at pull request creation with code review checklist alignment and gate-based constitutional compliance verification

### Key Entities

- **Core Principles**: Four foundational non-negotiable standards (Code Quality Excellence, Comprehensive Testing Standards, User Experience Consistency, Performance Requirements) with specific manufacturing environment rationale and implementation requirements
- **Quality Assurance Standards**: Automated review gates including build validation, test coverage requirements, security analysis, and manufacturing domain compliance with specific thresholds and validation criteria  
- **Performance Standards**: Measurable system performance gates including database query timeouts, UI responsiveness benchmarks, memory usage limits, and cross-platform rendering consistency with monitoring requirements
- **Governance Framework**: Constitutional authority structure defining amendment process, compliance verification mechanisms, and integration with existing instruction library while maintaining ultimate authority over all development practices
