# Data Model: Constitutional Governance Entities

**Date**: September 27, 2025  
**Feature**: 100% Fully Developed Constitution.md File

## Core Entities

### Core Principles

**Entity**: Constitutional Principle  
**Fields**:

- `name`: String (required) - Principle identifier ("Code Quality Excellence", "Testing Standards", etc.)
- `priority`: Integer (required) - Hierarchy ranking (1=highest, 4=lowest)
- `description`: String (required) - Detailed principle definition
- `rationale`: String (required) - Manufacturing-specific justification
- `requirements`: Array[String] (required) - Specific implementation requirements
- `enforcement_level`: Enum (required) - "NON-NEGOTIABLE" | "RECOMMENDED"
- `validation_criteria`: Array[String] (required) - Measurable compliance criteria

**Relationships**:

- Has many Quality Gates
- Has many Performance Benchmarks
- Referenced by Governance Decisions

**Validation Rules**:

- Priority must be unique across all principles (1-4)
- Name must be unique
- All NON-NEGOTIABLE principles require at least 3 validation criteria
- Rationale must reference manufacturing context

**State Transitions**:

1. Draft → Under Review (when created)
2. Under Review → Approved (Repository Owner + @Agent approval)
3. Approved → Active (when constitution published)
4. Active → Amendment Process (when changes requested)
5. Amendment Process → Active (when amendments approved)

### Quality Assurance Standards

**Entity**: QA Standard  
**Fields**:

- `category`: Enum (required) - "BUILD_VALIDATION" | "TEST_COVERAGE" | "SECURITY_ANALYSIS" | "DOMAIN_VALIDATION"
- `threshold`: Number (required) - Measurable compliance threshold (e.g., 80 for test coverage)
- `measurement_unit`: String (required) - Unit of measurement ("percentage", "seconds", "count")
- `validation_method`: String (required) - How compliance is verified
- `failure_action`: Enum (required) - "BLOCK" | "WARN" | "LOG"
- `applicable_platforms`: Array[String] (required) - ["Windows", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"]

**Relationships**:

- Belongs to Core Principle
- Has many Validation Results
- Referenced by CI/CD Pipeline

**Validation Rules**:

- Threshold must be positive number
- All platforms must be supported for cross-platform features
- Validation method must be automatable

### Performance Standards  

**Entity**: Performance Benchmark  
**Fields**:

- `metric_name`: String (required) - Performance metric identifier
- `target_value`: Number (required) - Target performance value
- `maximum_value`: Number (required) - Maximum acceptable value  
- `measurement_unit`: String (required) - Unit ("seconds", "MB", "percentage")
- `measurement_context`: String (required) - When/how measured
- `platform_specific`: Boolean (required) - Whether values vary by platform
- `monitoring_required`: Boolean (required) - Whether continuous monitoring needed

**Relationships**:

- Belongs to Core Principle (Performance Requirements)
- Has many Performance Measurements
- Referenced by Monitoring Systems

**Validation Rules**:

- Target value must be less than maximum value
- Manufacturing context measurements required for 8+ hour sessions
- Cross-platform variance must be within 5%

### Governance Framework

**Entity**: Governance Decision  
**Fields**:

- `decision_id`: String (required) - Unique identifier
- `decision_type`: Enum (required) - "AMENDMENT" | "INTERPRETATION" | "ENFORCEMENT"
- `description`: String (required) - Decision details
- `requestor`: String (required) - Who initiated the decision
- `approvers`: Array[String] (required) - ["Repository Owner", "@Agent"]  
- `rationale`: String (required) - Business justification
- `impact_assessment`: String (required) - Analyzed consequences
- `approval_status`: Enum (required) - "PENDING" | "APPROVED" | "REJECTED"
- `effective_date`: Date (optional) - When decision takes effect
- `review_date`: Date (optional) - Scheduled review date

**Relationships**:

- References Core Principles (affected principles)
- Has many Implementation Tasks
- Belongs to Amendment Process

**Validation Rules**:

- All amendments require both Repository Owner and @Agent approval
- Impact assessment required for all amendments
- Business justification must reference manufacturing requirements
- Effective date cannot be in the past

## Data Lifecycle

### Constitutional Development Lifecycle

1. **Research Phase**: Entity definitions created
2. **Design Phase**: Entity relationships established
3. **Implementation Phase**: Constitution document generated from entities
4. **Validation Phase**: Compliance checking against entity constraints
5. **Maintenance Phase**: Ongoing governance through amendment process

### Compliance Validation Lifecycle

1. **Pull Request Trigger**: CI/CD validates against QA Standards
2. **Automated Checking**: Performance Standards measured
3. **Review Process**: Governance Decisions applied
4. **Compliance Report**: Validation Results generated
5. **Enforcement Action**: Based on failure_action configuration

## Manufacturing Domain Integration

### MTM Business Rules Validation

All constitutional entities must validate against:

- Valid operations: 90, 100, 110, 120
- Location codes: FLOOR, RECEIVING, SHIPPING, etc.
- Transaction types: IN, OUT, TRANSFER
- Part ID format consistency
- Quantity validation (integer only)
- Session timeout: 60 minutes
- Quick buttons limit: 10 per user

### Cross-Platform Consistency

All entities with platform_specific fields must maintain:

- Performance variance within 5%
- Feature parity across Windows/macOS/Linux/Android
- Consistent validation criteria per platform
- Manufacturing operator workflow compatibility

## Implementation Constraints

- All entities stored as structured data within constitution.md
- Entity validation performed at document generation time
- Compliance checking automated via CI/CD pipeline
- Amendment process maintains entity consistency
- @Agent-based development optimized for 30-day compliance timeline
