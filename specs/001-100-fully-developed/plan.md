# Implementation Plan: 100% Fully Developed Constitution.md File

**Branch**: `001-100-fully-developed` | **Date**: September 27, 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-100-fully-developed/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

Create a comprehensive constitutional governance document that defines non-negotiable development standards, quality assurance requirements, and performance benchmarks for MTM WIP Application development. The constitution will establish 4 core principles (Code Quality Excellence, Comprehensive Testing Standards, User Experience Consistency, Performance Requirements), governance framework with Repository Owner and @Agent approval authority, and automated compliance verification at pull request creation.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Markdown documentation (.md format)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Git version control, CI/CD pipeline integration, .github/instructions/ library  
**Storage**: Version-controlled documentation in repository root  
**Testing**: Constitutional compliance validation via automated checks  
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform development teams (Windows/macOS/Linux/Android)
**Project Type**: Documentation - governance document for MTM WIP Application  
**Performance Goals**: Immediate accessibility (<1 second load time), CI/CD integration (<30 second validation)  
**Constraints**: Repository Owner and @Agent approval required, 30-day legacy code compliance timeline  
**Scale/Scope**: Enterprise manufacturing development team governance, 34+ instruction files integration

- [x] Document mandates end-to-end manufacturing operator workflow tests

### User Experience Consistency Gate

- [x] Document specifies Avalonia UI 11.3.4 with semantic theming system
- [x] Document requires responsive layouts (1024x768 to 4K)
- [x] Document mandates Material Design iconography usage
- [x] Document requires manufacturing operator-optimized workflows (minimal clicks)

### Performance Requirements Gate

- [x] Document defines database operations under 30 seconds timeout
- [x] Document requires UI responsiveness during concurrent operations
- [x] Document mandates memory optimization for 8+ hour sessions
- [x] Document specifies MySQL connection pooling (5-100 connections)
- [x] Document requires startup time under 10 seconds target

**Structure Decision**: Documentation-focused governance structure with primary constitution.md at repository root, integrated with existing .github/instructions/ library, and constitutional compliance validation in CI/CD pipeline.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```bash
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType copilot`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P]
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:

- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |

## Progress Tracking

*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:

- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command) - research.md created
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command) - data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md created
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:

- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented (none required)
