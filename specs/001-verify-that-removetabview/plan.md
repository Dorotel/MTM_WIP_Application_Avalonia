## Key Discoveries

### Project Structure

RemoveTabView is located in `Views/MainForm/Panels/` as part of the main tabbed interface, not at root level. The implementation follows established MTM patterns with proper separation of concerns.

### Implementation Patterns

- **MVVM Architecture**: Complete separation with ViewModel handling all business logic
- **Service Layer Integration**: Database, UI overlays, QuickButtons, printing, navigation services
- **Event-Driven Design**: Proper event handling for user interactions, ViewModel updates, and cross-component communication
- **Resource Management**: Proper disposal patterns, event unwiring, and memory leak prevention

### Complete Examples

```csharp
// MVVM Community Toolkit Pattern
[ObservableProperty]
private string? _selectedPart;

[RelayCommand]
private async Task Search()
{
    var result = await _removeService.SearchInventoryAsync(SelectedPart, SelectedOperation, null, null);
    // Implementation with proper error handling and UI updates
}

// Material Design Integration
<materialIcons:MaterialIcon Kind="Package" Classes="ManufacturingTitleIcon"/>
<materialIcons:MaterialIcon Kind="Identifier" Classes="ManufacturingFieldIcon"/>

// MTM Theming Integration  
<Border Background="{DynamicResource MTM_Shared_Logic.CardBackgroundBrush}"
        BorderBrush="{DynamicResource MTM_Shared_Logic.BorderLightBrush}"/>
```

### API and Schema Documentation

# Implementation Plan: Verify RemoveTabView Implementation

**Branch**: `001-verify-that-removetabview` | **Date**: 2025-09-27 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-verify-that-removetabview/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

All technical unknowns resolved through comprehensive analysis - **research.md created**:

✅ **Technology Stack Confirmed**: .NET 8.0 with C# 12, Avalonia UI 11.3.4, MVVM Community Toolkit 8.3.2, MySQL 9.4.0  
✅ **Implementation Patterns Identified**: MVVM with source generators, stored procedures, centralized error handling  
✅ **Cross-Platform Requirements Validated**: Windows/macOS/Linux/Android support with responsive layouts  
✅ **Manufacturing Domain Context Established**: Valid operations (90/100/110), transaction types (IN/OUT/TRANSFER)  
✅ **Testing Framework Confirmed**: xUnit with Avalonia.Headless, Moq for mocking, FluentAssertions  

**Output**: [research.md](./research.md) with comprehensive implementation analysis completed

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType copilot`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

**VERIFICATION TESTING TASK GENERATION STRATEGY**:

Since this is a **verification feature** (not new development), the task generation strategy focuses on comprehensive testing and validation rather than implementation:

**Primary Task Categories**:

1. **Unit Tests**: RemoveItemViewModel property and command verification [P]
2. **Integration Tests**: RemoveService method validation with mocked dependencies [P]  
3. **UI Tests**: Avalonia UI component behavior verification using Headless framework [P]
4. **Contract Tests**: JSON schema validation against actual service responses [P]
5. **Cross-Platform Tests**: Windows/macOS/Linux compatibility validation
6. **End-to-End Tests**: Complete manufacturing operator workflow validation

**Task Generation from Design Artifacts**:

- **data-model.md** → Model validation tests (InventoryItem, ServiceResult, RemovalResult)
- **contracts/search-operations.json** → Search functionality verification tests
- **contracts/removal-operations.json** → Removal and undo functionality tests  
- **contracts/ui-interactions.json** → UI behavior and keyboard shortcut tests
- **quickstart.md** → Manual verification checklist automation
- **40 Functional Requirements** → Automated requirement compliance tests

**Constitutional Compliance Testing**:

- Code Quality Excellence verification (MVVM Community Toolkit patterns)
- Testing Standards validation (5-tier testing approach)
- User Experience Consistency checks (cross-platform layout)  
- Performance Requirements validation (30-second timeout, responsiveness)

**Ordering Strategy**:

- **Phase 1**: Infrastructure setup and test data preparation
- **Phase 2**: Contract and unit tests (parallel execution) [P]
- **Phase 3**: Integration and service tests (dependency-based ordering)
- **Phase 4**: UI automation and cross-platform tests
- **Phase 5**: End-to-end workflow validation and performance testing

**Estimated Output**: 35-40 numbered verification tasks with constitutional compliance gates

**IMPORTANT**: This verification-focused approach validates existing implementation rather than creating new code

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
