# Tasks: RemoveTabView.axaml 100% Implementation Verification

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-verify-that-removetabview/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ✅, research.md ✅, data-model.md ✅, contracts/ ✅

## Execution Flow (verification)

```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ✅
   → Implementation plan found with complete technical context
   → Extract: .NET 8.0, Avalonia UI 11.3.4, MVVM Community Toolkit 8.3.2
2. Load design documents ✅:
   → data-model.md: 5 core entities → validation tasks
   → contracts/: 3 JSON schema files → contract test tasks
   → research.md: 100% implementation confirmed → verification tasks
3. Generate verification tasks by category:
   → Setup: test environment, database, dependencies
   → Tests: contract validation, integration tests, UI tests
   → Core: functional requirement verification (FR-001 through FR-040)
   → Integration: cross-platform compatibility, database validation
   → Polish: performance testing, accessibility validation, documentation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different verification areas = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same component verification = sequential (no [P])
   → Contract tests before functional verification (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph for verification workflow
7. Create parallel execution examples for independent tests
8. Validate verification completeness:
   → All 40 functional requirements covered?
   → All 3 contracts tested?
   → All 5 entities validated?
   → Cross-platform compatibility verified?
9. Return: SUCCESS (verification tasks ready for execution)
```

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different components/files, no dependencies
- Verification focuses on existing implementation rather than new development
- All 40 functional requirements mapped to specific verification tasks
- Contract tests validate JSON schemas against actual behavior
- Cross-platform tests ensure constitutional compliance across all platforms
- Performance tests validate constitutional timeout and efficiency requirements

## Constitutional Compliance Verification

*Aligned with .specify/memory/constitution.md principles*

- **Code Quality Excellence**: Verified through contract tests and integration validation
- **Testing Standards**: 5-tier testing implemented (Unit, Integration, UI, Cross-Platform, End-to-End)
- **User Experience Consistency**: Cross-platform compatibility and accessibility verification
- **Performance Requirements**: Timeout handling, memory management, and responsiveness testing
