# Feature Specification: RemoveTabView.axaml 100% Implementation Verification

**Feature Branch**: `001-verify-that-removetabview`  
**Created**: 2025-09-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Verify that RemoveTabView.axaml is 100% implemented - comprehensive validation of all features, UI components, bindings, commands, error handling, accessibility compliance, and cross-platform compatibility"

## Execution Flow (verification)

```
1. Analyze RemoveTabView.axaml implementation status
   ‚Üí Identify: UI components, data bindings, command implementations, error handling
2. Extract verification requirements from MTM constitution
   ‚Üí Code Quality Excellence, Testing Standards, UX Consistency, Performance Requirements
3. Define comprehensive validation scenarios
   ‚Üí Manufacturing operator workflows, cross-platform compatibility, accessibility
4. Create testable acceptance criteria
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be measurably verifiable
5. Identify verification gaps and missing implementations
   ‚Üí Mark incomplete features requiring specification
6. Run constitutional compliance review
   ‚Üí Validate against MTM WIP Application constitution principles
7. Return: VERIFICATION PLAN (ready for implementation validation)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

Manufacturing operators need to remove inventory items from the system through a reliable, efficient interface that supports search, selection, bulk operations, and audit trails. The RemoveTabView must provide complete functionality for inventory removal workflows while maintaining constitutional compliance for code quality, testing, user experience, and performance standards.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the RemoveTabView is displayed, **When** operator enters Part ID and Operation, **Then** system displays matching inventory items in DataGrid with proper formatting and selection capabilities
2. **Given** inventory items are displayed, **When** operator selects items and clicks Delete, **Then** system removes selected items with confirmation dialog and audit trail
3. **Given** removal operations are performed, **When** operator clicks Undo, **Then** system restores previously removed items with complete data integrity
4. **Given** search results are displayed, **When** operator uses keyboard shortcuts (F5, Escape, Delete, Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+P), **Then** system responds appropriately to all shortcuts
5. **Given** the interface is displayed on different platforms, **When** operator interacts with controls, **Then** UI maintains consistent behavior and appearance across Windows/macOS/Linux

### Edge Cases

- What happens when no inventory items match search criteria?
- How does system handle network connection failures during removal operations?
- What occurs when user attempts to remove items without proper permissions?
- How does system respond to concurrent removal operations from multiple users?
- What happens when database operations exceed 30-second constitutional timeout?
- How does system handle invalid Part ID or Operation number formats?
- What occurs when user attempts to undo operations that cannot be reversed?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
