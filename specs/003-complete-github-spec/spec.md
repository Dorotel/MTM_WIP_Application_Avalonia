## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a **manufacturing software developer** working on the MTM WIP Application, I need an enhanced GitHub Spec Commands system that integrates accumulated knowledge from memory files, validates my development workflow at each step, works across all platforms, and maintains state throughout the development process, so that I can leverage learned patterns, ensure constitutional compliance, and deliver manufacturing-grade software efficiently.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a developer starts a new feature, **When** they run `/constitution`, **Then** the system validates constitutional compliance and integrates all relevant memory file patterns for the current development context

2. **Given** a developer runs `/specify` with a feature description, **When** the system processes the specification, **Then** it automatically integrates Avalonia UI memory patterns and custom control development knowledge from memory files

3. **Given** a developer encounters a problem during development, **When** they run `/clarify`, **Then** the system uses debugging memory workflows and systematic problem-solving patterns to guide clarification questions

4. **Given** a developer completes the analysis phase, **When** they run `/validate`, **Then** the system confirms all workflow steps are complete using memory-driven quality gates and reports readiness for next phase

5. **Given** a developer works on Windows, macOS, or Linux, **When** they execute any GSC command via Git Bash, **Then** the system functions identically across all platforms with consistent state management

6. **Given** a developer makes an error in the workflow, **When** they run `/rollback`, **Then** the system resets to the beginning of the current GSC workflow phase while preserving accumulated memory patterns and learned knowledge

7. **Given** a developer is working in VS Code or Visual Studio 2022, **When** they use GitHub Copilot Chat to execute GSC commands like `/specify` or `/help`, **Then** the system executes the command with full memory integration and returns formatted results within the chat interface

### Edge Cases

- What happens when memory files are corrupted or inaccessible?
- How does the system handle GSC command execution in environments without PowerShell Core?
- What occurs when workflow state files become inconsistent across team members?
- How does the system manage memory file conflicts when multiple developers contribute patterns?
- What happens when @github/spec-kit integration fails or is unavailable?
- How does the system maintain manufacturing operations when performance degradation triggers graceful degradation mode?
- How does the system handle GSC command execution when GitHub Copilot Chat is offline or when the user lacks Copilot access?
- What happens when there are conflicts between GitHub Copilot Chat command execution and concurrent PowerShell GSC command execution?

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-28

- Q: Memory File Update Strategy: When the system discovers new patterns during development sessions, how should it handle conflicting or contradictory patterns already stored in memory files? → A: Replace conflicting patterns with newer ones, maintain single source of truth
- Q: Team Collaboration Mode: In multi-user manufacturing environments, how should the system handle workflow state when multiple developers work on the same feature branch simultaneously? → A: Lock-based approach: First developer locks workflow, others must wait
- Q: Rollback Granularity: When developers use the `/rollback` command, what level of rollback should be supported to balance safety with flexibility? → A: Full workflow reset: Return to beginning of current GSC workflow phase
- Q: Performance Degradation Response: When the system detects performance issues that could impact 24/7 manufacturing operations, what should be the automatic response? → A: Graceful degradation: Reduce memory file complexity, maintain core functionality
- Q: Memory File Security: Given that memory files contain accumulated development patterns and potentially sensitive information, what level of security should be implemented for memory file access and updates? → A: Moderate protection: Checksum validation and basic encryption at rest
- Q: Performance Degradation Specific Actions: What specific actions should the system take when performance degradation is triggered? → A: Reduce to single memory file (highest priority only)
- Q: Team Collaboration Lock Timeout: What should be the lock timeout duration to align with manufacturing shift operations? → A: 8 hours (single shift duration)
- Q: GSC Memory Command File Access Pattern: How should the gsc-memory command handle GET and POST operations in the same PowerShell file? → A: Parameter-based: Single file with operation parameter

### Clarification Session: Interactive Help System Implementation

- Q: Interactive HTML Help File Structure: What specific content structure and organization should the interactive HTML help file follow to provide comprehensive coverage of all GSC features while maintaining usability? → A: Multi-section structure with collapsible navigation, command reference with examples, workflow guides with step-by-step instructions, memory integration documentation with pattern examples, troubleshooting guides with common issues, and interactive search functionality
- Q: Help Command Integration Points: How should the `/help` command integrate with existing GSC workflow state and memory system to provide contextual help relevant to the current development phase? → A: Context-aware help that highlights commands relevant to current workflow phase, shows applicable memory patterns for current context, provides next-step recommendations, and includes progress-based guidance
- Q: Cross-Platform Help Display: What approach should be used to ensure the interactive HTML help system works consistently across Windows, macOS, and Linux environments with different default browsers and PowerShell configurations? → A: Generate self-contained HTML file with embedded CSS/JavaScript, provide fallback console output for environments without browser support, use cross-platform file paths, and include platform-specific setup instructions

### Clarification Session: GitHub Copilot Chat Integration

- Q: GitHub Copilot Chat Command Registration: How should GSC commands be registered and discovered within GitHub Copilot Chat in VS Code and Visual Studio 2022 to ensure they appear in command completion and help systems? → A: Use @github/copilot-extensions SDK for command registration, implement command metadata with descriptions and parameter schemas, provide autocomplete support, and integrate with existing Copilot Chat slash command framework
- Q: Chat Output Formatting: What specific formatting approach should be used for GSC command outputs in GitHub Copilot Chat to maximize readability and usability within the chat interface constraints? → A: Use markdown formatting with collapsible sections, code blocks with syntax highlighting, structured tables for data presentation, inline links for navigation, and emoji/icons for status indicators
- Q: State Synchronization: How should the system ensure workflow state remains consistent when developers switch between GitHub Copilot Chat execution and standalone PowerShell execution of GSC commands? → A: Implement shared JSON state files with file locking, provide state validation on command execution, include state repair mechanisms for detected inconsistencies, and offer state synchronization commands

### Session 2025-09-28 (Second Round)

- Q: Error Recovery Strategy: When memory file corruption is detected during GSC command execution, what should be the system's recovery behavior to maintain manufacturing operations continuity? → A: Fallback to cached patterns from previous session and continue operation
- Q: Dependency Installation Strategy: When the system detects missing dependencies (@github/spec-kit or PowerShell Core 7.0+) during GSC command execution, what should be the automatic installation approach? → A: Automatic silent installation with user notification after completion
- Q: Memory Pattern Priority Strategy: When multiple memory files contain conflicting recommendations for the same development context, what should be the system's pattern selection approach? → A: Apply domain-specific priority rules (Avalonia > debugging > general)
