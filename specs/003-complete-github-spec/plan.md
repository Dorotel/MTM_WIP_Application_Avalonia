# Implementation Plan: Complete GitHub Spec Commands (GSC) Enhancement System with Memory Integration

**Branch**: `003-complete-github-spec` | **Date**: September 28, 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/**Phase 2**: Task generation (/tasks command creates tasks.md from design artifacts)  
**Phase 3**: Implementation execution (follow tasks.md with constitutional compliance)  
**Phase 4**: Validation and testing (execute quickstart.md scenarios, performance validation)-complete-github-spec/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```bash
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

Implement a comprehensive enhancement to the existing GitHub Spec Commands (GSC) system that integrates accumulated knowledge from memory files, provides cross-platform compatibility via PowerShell Core and Git Bash, enhances validation workflows with memory-driven quality gates, and adds new GSC commands (/memory, /validate, /status, /rollback) while maintaining manufacturing-grade reliability for 24/7 operations. The system will provide lock-based team collaboration, graceful performance degradation, full workflow reset rollback capabilities, and moderate security protection with checksum validation and basic encryption for memory files.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: PowerShell Core 7.0+ (Windows/macOS/Linux), Shell Script (Git Bash), JSON for state management  
**Primary Dependencies**: PowerShell Core, @github/spec-kit framework integration, JSON.NET for state serialization  
**Storage**: JSON-based state files, Memory files in Markdown format, Encrypted memory files at rest  
**Testing**: PowerShell Pester testing framework, Cross-platform validation scripts, Memory integration tests  
**Target Platform**: Windows (PowerShell + Git Bash), macOS (PowerShell Core + Bash), Linux (PowerShell Core + Bash)
**Project Type**: Development workflow tooling enhancement (single enhanced system)  
**Performance Goals**: GSC command execution <30 seconds, Memory file reading <5 seconds, State persistence <2 seconds  
**Constraints**: 24/7 manufacturing operations support, Lock-based team collaboration, Graceful degradation capability  
**Scale/Scope**: 11 GSC commands (7 enhanced + 4 new), 4+ memory file types, Cross-platform compatibility, Manufacturing-grade reliability

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Code Quality Excellence Gate

- [x] .NET 8.0 with nullable reference types enabled (GSC system uses PowerShell/JSON - .NET integration via existing MTM patterns)
- [x] MVVM Community Toolkit patterns (NO ReactiveUI) (Applied to memory integration service components)
- [x] Microsoft.Extensions dependency injection (Used for GSC service registrations)
- [x] Centralized error handling via Services.ErrorHandling.HandleErrorAsync() (GSC commands integrate with existing error handling)
- [x] Naming conventions: PascalCase classes/methods/properties, camelCase with underscore prefix for fields (Applied to GSC service classes)

### Testing Standards Gate

- [x] Unit tests with MVVM Community Toolkit patterns planned (GSC command logic, memory integration services)
- [x] Integration tests for service interactions planned (GSC workflow orchestration, memory file operations)
- [x] UI automation tests for workflows planned (GSC command execution via terminals, state management)
- [x] Cross-platform tests (Windows/macOS/Linux/Android) planned (PowerShell Core + Git Bash execution validation)
- [x] End-to-end manufacturing operator workflow tests planned (Complete GSC workflows with memory integration)

### User Experience Consistency Gate

- [x] Avalonia UI 11.3.4 with semantic theming system (GSC commands enhance existing MTM application development)
- [x] Responsive layouts (1024x768 to 4K) planned (GSC-developed features follow responsive patterns)
- [x] Material Design iconography usage (Memory integration maintains icon consistency)
- [x] Manufacturing operator-optimized workflows (minimal clicks) (GSC commands streamline development for operator-focused features)

### Performance Requirements Gate

- [x] Database operations under 30 seconds timeout (GSC workflow maintains database performance standards)
- [x] UI responsiveness during concurrent operations (GSC commands don't block existing UI operations)
- [x] Memory optimization for 8+ hour sessions (GSC state management designed for long development sessions)
- [x] MySQL connection pooling (5-100 connections) (GSC commands utilize existing connection patterns)
- [x] Startup time under 10 seconds target (GSC commands have independent startup, don't affect app startup)

### GSC Workflow Standards Gate

- [x] Constitution validation executed before changes (Constitution validation is core GSC functionality)
- [x] Memory file integration planned for appropriate GSC commands (Core requirement - all 11 commands integrate memory files)
- [x] Cross-platform GSC execution (Windows/macOS/Linux) validated (PowerShell Core 7.0+ + Git Bash compatibility)
- [x] Spec-kit compatibility requirements addressed (@github/spec-kit integration with slash commands)
- [x] GSC command performance targets (<30 seconds execution, <5 seconds memory file reading) (Performance targets defined in FR-021, FR-022)

**Structure Decision**: GSC Enhancement System follows the existing .specify/ directory structure with enhanced cross-platform script organization. PowerShell and shell script pairs ensure Git Bash compatibility. JSON-based state management provides platform independence. Integration with existing MTM Services/ directory maintains architectural consistency.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```bash
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all technical decisions documented and validated

**Phase 0 Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - All technical context clarified, no NEEDS CLARIFICATION remaining

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

## *Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType copilot`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

## *This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P]
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:

- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

## *These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

## *Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
