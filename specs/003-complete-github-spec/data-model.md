**Feature**: Complete GitHub Spec Commands Enhancement System  
**Date**: September 28, 2025

## Core Entities

### GSC Command Entity

Represents individual workflow commands with enhanced memory integration capabilities.

**Properties**:

- `CommandName`: String (constitution, specify, clarify, plan, task, analyze, implement, memory, validate, status, rollback)
- `ExecutionLogic`: PowerShell script path and shell wrapper path
- `ValidationRules`: List of constitutional and workflow validation requirements
- `MemoryIntegrationPoints`: List of applicable memory file patterns and triggers
- `StateManagementRequirements`: JSON state dependencies and persistence requirements

- `PerformanceTargets`: Execution time limits and resource constraints

**Validation Rules**:

- CommandName must be one of the 11 defined GSC commands
- ExecutionLogic must have both .ps1 and .sh implementations
- MemoryIntegrationPoints must reference valid memory file patterns
- PerformanceTargets must not exceed constitutional limits (30s execution, 5s memory reading)

**State Transitions**:

- `NotStarted` → `Executing` → `Completed` | `Failed`
- `Failed` → `Retrying` → `Completed` | `PermanentFailure`
- `Completed` → `NotStarted` (for rollback scenarios)

### Memory File Entity

Contains accumulated development patterns with security and integrity protection.

**Properties**:

- `FilePath`: Absolute path to memory file in user's prompts directory
- `FileType`: String (avalonia-ui-memory, debugging-memory, memory, avalonia-custom-controls-memory)
- `Content`: Markdown-formatted accumulated development patterns and lessons learned
- `Metadata`: Creation date, last modified date, pattern count, applicability rules
- `IntegrationTriggers`: List of GSC commands that should reference this memory file
- `ChecksumHash`: SHA-256 hash for integrity validation

- `ApplicabilityRules`: Context-matching rules for when patterns should be applied

**Validation Rules**:

- FilePath must exist and be readable

**State Transitions**:

- `Pending` → `Running` → `Passed` | `Failed` | `Warning`
- `Failed` → `Retrying` → `Passed` | `PermanentFailure`
- `Warning` → `Acknowledged` → `Resolved`

### State File Entity

JSON-based persistence mechanism with cross-platform compatibility.

**Properties**:

- `FileName`: String (gsc-workflow.json, validation-status.json, constitutional-compliance.json, memory-integration.json)
- `FilePath`: Absolute path to state file in .specify/state/ directory
- `Content`: JSON-serialized state data with structured schema
- `Version`: State file format version for backward compatibility
- `LastModified`: Timestamp of last update for synchronization
- `LockStatus`: File lock information for atomic operations
- `BackupPath`: Path to backup file for recovery scenarios
- `CrossPlatformCompatibility`: Ensures consistent behavior across Windows/macOS/Linux

**Validation Rules**:

- FileName must be one of the 4 defined state file types
- Content must be valid JSON with required schema
- Version must be compatible with current GSC system version
- LockStatus must prevent concurrent modification conflicts
- BackupPath must be accessible for recovery operations

**State Transitions**:

- `NonExistent` → `Creating` → `Created` | `Failed`
- `Locked` → `Updating` → `Updated` | `Failed`
- `Corrupted` → `Recovering` → `Restored` | `Unrecoverable`

## Entity Relationships

### GSC Command ↔ Memory File

- **One-to-Many**: Each GSC command can integrate multiple memory files
- **Relationship**: GSC commands read and apply relevant memory file patterns
- **Constraints**: Memory integration must complete within 5 seconds per command

### GSC Command ↔ Workflow State

- **Many-to-One**: Multiple GSC commands contribute to single workflow state
- **Relationship**: Each command updates workflow progress and validation status
- **Constraints**: State updates must be atomic and platform-independent

### Memory File ↔ Validation Script

- **Many-to-Many**: Memory files can be validated by multiple scripts, scripts can validate multiple memory files
- **Relationship**: Validation scripts ensure memory file integrity and applicability
- **Constraints**: Validation must include checksum verification and content analysis

### Workflow State ↔ State File

- **One-to-Four**: Each workflow state is persisted across 4 specialized state files
- **Relationship**: State files provide durable storage for workflow progress
- **Constraints**: All state files must remain consistent and support atomic updates

### Team Collaboration Lock ↔ Workflow State

- **One-to-One**: Each workflow can have at most one active lock
- **Relationship**: Locks prevent workflow conflicts in multi-user environments
- **Constraints**: Locks must respect manufacturing shift patterns and 24/7 operations

## Data Persistence Strategy

### JSON State Files Schema

```json
{
  "gsc-workflow.json": {
    "workflowId": "string",
    "currentPhase": "string",
    "phaseHistory": [
      {
        "phase": "string",
        "timestamp": "ISO8601",
        "result": "string",
        "memoryPatternsApplied": ["string"]
      }
    ],
    "checkpointData": "object",
    "performanceDegradationMode": "boolean"
  }
}
```

### Memory File Processing Schema

```json
{
  "memory-integration.json": {
    "sessionId": "string",
    "memoryFilesProcessed": [
      {
        "filePath": "string",
        "fileType": "string",
        "processedAt": "ISO8601",
        "patternsExtracted": ["string"],
        "appliedToCommands": ["string"],
        "checksumValidated": "boolean"
      }
    ],
    "totalProcessingTime": "number",
    "patternsAppliedCount": "number"
  }
}
```

### Cross-Platform Compatibility Requirements

- Use `Path.Combine()` equivalent for all file paths
- Store timestamps in ISO8601 format with UTC timezone
- Use forward slashes in JSON file paths for consistency
- Implement atomic file operations with temporary files and moves
- Support both Windows-style and Unix-style line endings

## Security and Integrity

### Memory File Protection

- **Checksum Validation**: SHA-256 hash verification before processing
- **Basic Encryption**: PowerShell SecureString encryption at rest
- **Access Logging**: Record all memory file access and modification attempts
- **Integrity Monitoring**: Detect unauthorized changes to memory files

### State File Security

- **Atomic Operations**: Prevent corruption during concurrent access
- **Lock Management**: File-based locking for team collaboration
- **Backup Strategy**: Automatic backups before state changes
- **Recovery Procedures**: Restore from backups on corruption detection

## Performance Optimization

### Memory File Caching

- **Pattern Cache**: Store extracted patterns to avoid re-parsing
- **File Change Detection**: Monitor file modification times
- **Selective Loading**: Load only relevant memory files per GSC command
- **Graceful Degradation**: Reduce memory file complexity under performance pressure

### State Persistence Optimization

- **Incremental Updates**: Only write changed portions of state files
- **Batch Operations**: Group multiple state changes into single write
- **Compression**: Use JSON compression for large state files
- **Cleanup**: Remove old state files and checkpoints automatically
