## Summary

This feature equips GitHub Copilot Chat with full control of the GSC workflow so developers can execute, monitor, and validate specification-driven development without leaving the chat interface. The plan delivers slash command registration through the @github/copilot-extensions SDK, a resilient bridge to the existing PowerShell scripts, synchronized workflow state and memory insights, and parity testing to ensure the chat output matches terminal execution. Performance and availability targets (≤12 second response, ≥99.5% availability) plus single-user-oriented locking behavior are baked into the architecture and acceptance criteria.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: .NET 8.0 services + PowerShell Core 7.5, TypeScript 5.x for Copilot extension  
**Primary Dependencies**: @github/copilot-extensions SDK, Pester 5.7.1, Node.js 20 LTS toolchain, existing GSC PowerShell modules  
**Storage**: JSON state files under `.specify/state/` (workflow, validation, memory integration)  
**Testing**: Pester for PowerShell bridge, Vitest (or comparable Node test runner) for chat handlers, integration harness comparing chat vs CLI outputs  
**Target Platform**: Windows, macOS, and Linux developers using Copilot Chat in VS Code or Visual Studio 2022  
**Project Type**: Single solution with shared `.specify` automation directory  
**Performance Goals**: ≤12 s chat response, ≤5 s memory load, ≤2 s state persistence round-trip, PowerShell parity maintained  
**Constraints**: ≥99.5% availability during manufacturing hours, single-user lock enforcement (no queuing), offline fallback guidance, maintain constitution-mandated workflow order  
**Scale/Scope**: Primarily a single developer workflow today, but must remain robust for extended manufacturing use and future multi-user expansion

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Code Quality Excellence Gate

- [x] .NET 8.0 with nullable reference types enabled (PowerShell bridge relies on existing compliant services)
- [x] MVVM Community Toolkit patterns (NO ReactiveUI) (No UI model changes; existing toolkit usage remains authoritative)
- [x] Microsoft.Extensions dependency injection (Services receiving chat telemetry will follow DI patterns in `ServiceCollectionExtensions`)
- [x] Centralized error handling via Services.ErrorHandling.HandleErrorAsync() (Chat bridge logs errors through existing service)
- [x] Naming conventions: PascalCase classes/methods/properties, camelCase with underscore prefix for fields (Extension and service additions will follow standards)

### Testing Standards Gate

- [x] Unit tests with MVVM Community Toolkit patterns planned (Services touched will include unit coverage)
- [x] Integration tests for service interactions planned (Chat ↔ PowerShell harness validates end-to-end)
- [x] UI automation tests for workflows planned (Chat quickstart scenarios mirrored via automation harness)
- [x] Cross-platform tests (Windows/macOS/Linux/Android) planned (CLI parity tests executed across supported dev OSes; Android not applicable but documented)
- [x] End-to-end manufacturing operator workflow tests planned (Quickstart extends existing GSC scenarios through chat)

### User Experience Consistency Gate

- [x] Avalonia UI 11.3.4 with semantic theming system (No Avalonia UI delta; plan ensures any surfaced summaries follow established design language when rendered inside app surfaces)
- [x] Responsive layouts (1024x768 to 4K) planned (No change; chat outputs align with existing documentation layout)
- [x] Material Design iconography usage (Help references existing iconography guidance)
- [x] Manufacturing operator-optimized workflows (minimal clicks) (Chat flow mirrors current CLI quickstart to minimize steps)

### Performance Requirements Gate

- [x] Database operations under 30 seconds timeout (No DB impact; monitoring ensures baseline maintained)
- [x] UI responsiveness during concurrent operations (Chat response guidelines prevent blocking operations)
- [x] Memory optimization for 8+ hour sessions (State files remain lightweight; no long-lived chat memory)
- [x] MySQL connection pooling (5-100 connections) (Unaffected; documented to revalidate if services touched)
- [x] Startup time under 10 seconds target (No change to application startup)

### GSC Workflow Standards Gate

- [x] Constitution validation executed before changes (Workflow enforces `/constitution` before other chat commands)
- [x] Memory file integration planned for appropriate GSC commands (Bridge loads memory files using existing helper modules)
- [x] Cross-platform GSC execution (Windows/macOS/Linux) validated (Parity harness executes on each platform)
- [x] Spec-kit compatibility requirements addressed (Slash command metadata mirrors spec-kit expectations)
- [x] GSC command performance targets (<30 seconds execution, <5 seconds memory file reading) (Performance plan enforces these thresholds plus 12-second chat SLA)

**Structure Decision**: Maintain the single-project organization while expanding `.specify/extensions/copilot-chat` for the TypeScript handlers and reusing existing `Services/` and `tests/GSC` directories for orchestration and parity validation. No new top-level projects are required.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

- Conducted focused research on:
  - Command registration patterns within @github/copilot-extensions, including slash metadata, autocomplete, and output formatting expectations.
  - Bridging strategies for invoking PowerShell scripts from the extension runtime with consistent JSON envelopes and error propagation.
  - Workflow state synchronization design that reads `gsc-workflow.json`, `memory-integration.json`, and lock files safely across concurrent command executions.
  - Performance instrumentation to confirm ≤12 second chat SLA, along with fallback behavior when PowerShell or memory files are unavailable.
  - Concurrency handling tailored to single-user operation (locking errors surfaced immediately without queueing).
- Findings captured in `research.md` with decision/rationale/alternative tables for future reference.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

- `data-model.md` enumerates the primary entities (ChatCommandSession, WorkflowStateSnapshot, MemoryInsightSummary, LockNotice, PerformanceTelemetry) with attributes, relationships, and lifecycle notes.
- `contracts/copilot-chat-commands.json` documents each slash command, its parameters, and expected output sections, ensuring parity with existing PowerShell CLI usage and spec-kit metadata.
- `quickstart.md` provides a ready-to-run walkthrough covering prerequisites (PowerShell Core, extension install), sample chat sessions for top workflows, status verification, and troubleshooting steps.
- `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType copilot` will be executed after implementation details are finalized to register the new capabilities in Copilot context documentation.

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

- `/tasks` will derive tasks from the new design artifacts:
  - Contracts → Pester contract tests plus TypeScript handler tests ([P] per command because files differ).
  - Entities → Service updates, DTOs, and TypeScript interfaces ensuring serialization parity.
  - User stories → Integration/parity tests that replay quickstart scenarios via Copilot Chat and CLI for comparison.
- Tasks will follow TDD ordering: generate failing Pester + Vitest suites before implementing handlers or services.
- Parallelization guidelines: TypeScript handler work and PowerShell module updates can proceed in parallel; orchestration service refinements should land before parity tests flip to green.
- Estimated output: ~26 tasks spanning handler scaffolding, bridge enhancements, monitoring instrumentation, and documentation refresh.

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

- Phase 3: `/tasks` command materializes tasks.md using the above strategy.
- Phase 4: Execute tasks, ensuring constitutional principles and new performance/availability metrics are enforced.
- Phase 5: Validate by running Pester suites, TypeScript parity harness, and quickstart walkthrough across Windows/macOS/Linux developer environments.
