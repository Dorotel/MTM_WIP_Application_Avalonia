## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY: Manufacturing operators need efficient inventory transfer capabilities
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement: Specification focuses on user requirements, not technical implementation details
- üë• Written for business stakeholders: Manufacturing managers, quality assurance, system administrators

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-28

- Q: When column customization preferences are saved, what is the expected persistence scope for user preferences? ‚Üí A: Per user account - preferences saved globally using MySQL usr_ui_settings table with new stored procedure for "TransferTabColumns" setting stored as JSON
- Q: When transfer operations fail due to insufficient inventory quantity, what should be the system's response behavior? ‚Üí A: Transfers are location-to-location with quantity validation - textbox auto-caps at available quantity, partial transfers create new inventory row at destination with remaining quantity updated at source
- Q: When a partial transfer creates a new inventory row at the destination, what should happen to the transaction history and audit trail? ‚Üí A: Single transaction record showing original quantity with split details
- Q: When the EditInventoryView panel is displayed within the transfer interface, what triggers should open it and when should it automatically close? ‚Üí A: Double-click inventory row opens, closes on save/cancel, AND auto-closes after successful transfer
- Q: When database connectivity is lost during a transfer operation, what should be the recovery behavior? ‚Üí A: Show error message and require user to retry manually

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a manufacturing operator, I need to transfer inventory items between locations efficiently using a standardized interface that follows MTM design patterns, so I can maintain accurate inventory tracking and complete transfer operations quickly without system errors.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I am on the Transfer tab with no search criteria entered, **When** I enter a Part ID and Operation, **Then** the system displays available inventory items in a standard DataGrid with customizable columns
2. **Given** I have search results displayed, **When** I select an inventory item and click the column customization dropdown, **Then** I can choose which columns to display (PartID, Operation, FromLocation, AvailableQuantity, TransferQuantity, Notes)
3. **Given** I have selected an inventory item for transfer, **When** I enter a destination location and transfer quantity, **Then** the system validates the inputs and enables the Transfer button
4. **Given** I need to edit detailed inventory information, **When** I access the edit functionality, **Then** the EditInventoryView panel displays seamlessly integrated within the transfer interface
5. **Given** I complete a transfer operation, **When** the transaction processes successfully, **Then** the system updates inventory records and provides confirmation feedback
6. **Given** I am using the transfer interface, **When** I interact with any UI elements, **Then** all styling follows MTM Theme V2 patterns with proper DynamicResource bindings

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the destination location is invalid or doesn't exist?
- How does the system handle transfer quantities that exceed available inventory?
- When database connectivity is lost during a transfer operation, system displays error message and requires manual retry (no automatic retry or caching)
- How are column customization preferences persisted across user sessions?
- What happens when EditInventoryView integration fails to load properly?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST replace TransferCustomDataGrid with standard Avalonia DataGrid while maintaining all existing transfer functionality
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide column customization via standard Avalonia ComboBox dropdown styled with MTM Theme V2 with preferences persisted per user account in MySQL usr_ui_settings table using "TransferTabColumns" setting stored as JSON
- **FR-003**: System MUST display default columns for transfer operations: PartID, Operation, FromLocation, AvailableQuantity, TransferQuantity, Notes
- **FR-004**: System MUST enforce strict property-to-column mapping as documented in data-models.instructions.md to prevent runtime mapping errors
- **FR-005**: System MUST integrate EditInventoryView.axaml directly via AXAML namespace reference without code-behind instantiation
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain smooth transitions between main transfer view and EditInventoryView using standard Avalonia visibility binding patterns, opening on double-click and closing on save/cancel or after successful transfer
- **FR-007**: System MUST consolidate all action buttons in a single panel for consistent user experience
- **FR-008**: System MUST apply MTM Theme V2 styling exclusively using DynamicResource bindings with no hardcoded styling values
- **FR-009**: System MUST return only columns defined in actual MySQL database schema when processing search results
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate transfer operations with quantity auto-capping at available amount, creating new inventory row at destination for partial transfers while updating source quantity to remainder, preserving batch number and setting transfer user
- **FR-011**: System MUST follow MTM AXAML patterns strictly to prevent AVLN2000 compilation errors
- **FR-012**: System MUST ensure DataContext inheritance from parent or binding-based assignment for EditInventoryView integration
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features consistent with RemoveTabView.axaml patterns
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle error states gracefully with appropriate user feedback and manual retry requirement for database connectivity failures
- **FR-015**: System MUST support manufacturing operator workflows with minimal clicks and efficient data entry
- **FR-016**: System MUST record transfer operations as single transaction entries with original quantity and split details for audit trail purposes

### Key Entities

- **Inventory Item**: Represents a physical part with PartID, Operation, Location, and Available Quantity that can be transferred between locations
- **Transfer Operation**: Business transaction that moves inventory from one location to another with quantity tracking and validation
- **Location**: Manufacturing location identifier (FromLocation, ToLocation) that must be validated against master data
- **Column Configuration**: User preference settings for customizing DataGrid column visibility and arrangement
- **Edit Session**: Context for detailed inventory editing within the transfer workflow using integrated EditInventoryView
