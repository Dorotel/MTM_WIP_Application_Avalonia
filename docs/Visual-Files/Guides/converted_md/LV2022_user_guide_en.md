34 Creating a document using variable objects and 
data sources  
About data sources  
A data source contains a list of variables populated with data of the same origin. Data sources can be 
divided into categories and sub- categories except Database data source.  
When you select a data source, you are indicating where the data you are interested in is located and what type of  data you plan to use. The data can be of internal origin (formula, date, counter) or 
external to the application (database, direct entry).  
The different data sources available in the Data Sources view or menu are the following:  
• The Date  data source: Allows you to insert a date or time.  
• The Counter  data source: Allows you to insert a self -incrementing value.  
• The When Printed data source: Allows the data to be entered when printing.  
• The Formula  data source: Allows you to create formulas within your document.  
• The Database  data source: Allows you to connect a database.  
• The Table lookup data source: Allows you to add the result of searches carried out in 
databases.  
• The Advanced  data source: These data sources are populated by data that is not specified at 
creati on. This data source can be used to create intermediate data sources.  
 
Creating a data source  
Data sources allow you to use data external to the application; for example, calculated data, your 
computer's date system, etc. The values associated with these variables are supplied by different data 
sources.  
You can create a data source from:  
The Data sources view  
1. Choose View > Data sources. 
2. From the Data sources view, right -click one of the data sources.

48 Variable object creation  
A variable object is a text, barcode, or image type object, composed of elements whose the value is 
not defined at the moment of creation. Several objects can be associated with a single variable.  
The value of these elements is supplied by different data sources at the time of printing:  
• Direct ke yboard entry in the form  (When Printed data source)  
• Imported from an external file or database ( Table lookup or Database data sources)  
• Field calculated by the computer ( Formula , Counter , and Date data sources)  
Note: In the Data Sources  view, a red arrow  indicates the variable associated with the 
selected object.

51 Printing  
A powerful print engine  
Your software is a powerful, user -friendly creation tool and a print engine, bringing together the widest 
possible range of printers (thermal, thermal transfer and inkjet).  
Whether printing a single label, a series of labels, or multiple copies of the same label, all print 
commands ar e grouped together in the Print  dialog box.  
Your software also allows you to install and control printers located anywhere on your network.  
In this section, we will look at various possible network configurations and the associated installation procedures for optimizing label printing.  
 
Printing a document  
To print a document:  
1. Choose File > Print  to access the Print dialog box.  
You can also click the   button or press F6 . 
2. In the Labels text box, enter the number of labels to be printed.  
3. Click OK. 
  
Exercise: Label Series and Labels  
To start, let’s distinguish between Labels and Copies of each label . 
Note : If the label does not include a counter, the Print  dialog box will not display the Copies of each 
label  field, but will display the Labels  field. This field serves the same purpose.  
To highlight the difference between Labels and Copies of each label , we will consider a label 
containing two types of counters and configure the Print  dialog box in different ways.  
1. Open a label.  
2. Create two different counters:  

User Guide  
52 • A classical counter that counts all labels, and resets when its value reaches 10:  
• Type : Decimal  
• Increment: +1  
• Min value: 0  
• Max value: 10  
• An ISO counter that allows each label copy to be individually and exhaustively 
numbered. It also resets when its value reaches 10.  
• Type: Decimal  
• Increment: +1  
• Min value: 0  
The first counter identifies a particular label, whereas the ISO counter counts the total number of 
labels printed.  
Labels in the series  
In this example, we are going to print a series of 10 labels:  
1. Enter the following values in the Print  dialog box:  
• Labels: 10.  
This means that there are 10 different labels in the series.  
2. Click Print . 
Expected output: 10 labels have been printed and the two counters read the same value.  
Copies of each label 
Here we will print a series of five labels, but this time we want two copies of each label.  
1. Enter the f ollowing values in the Print  dialog box:  
• Labels: 5  
• Copies of each label : 2. 
2. Click Print . 
Expected output: 10 labels print; one counter is 1- 10 the other counter is 1,1,2,2,3,3...  
Copies of each page 
As we have just seen, it is possible to print multiple copies of the same label. In the next example, we 
will see that it is also possible to print multiple copies of the same page. We must understand exactly what the printer defines as a page.  
Printing  
53 The page definition is determined by the parameters speci fied when the printer driver is configured. 
The results may be completely different depending on whether you print on an office printer or a 
thermal printer. It can be quite difficult to visualize a page on continuous paper, which is used mainly 
by thermal  printers.  
Moreover, according to the dimension of the print media and the size of the label, the page 
dimensions may correspond to those of the label, and thus, the page copy may be the same as the label copy.  
The page format and label size are defined in  the Page Setup  dialog box.  
1. Open a label that contains a counter.  
2. Go to File > Select printer . 
3. Select a Windows office printer.  
4. Select a format, then click OK . 
5. Go to File > Page Setup  or click . 
The Page Setup  dialog box opens.  
The preview gives you an idea of how the page will look when it is printed.  
6. Close the dialog box.  
7. Click . 
8. Enter the following values:  
• Labels: 8  
• Copies of each page : 2 
9. Click Print . The result will be:  
 
To launch a print merge  
The Merge  option  is available when a merge database has been opened. It launches label printing 
including all records in the database.  

User Guide  
54 1. Choose File > Print  to access the Print dialog box.  
- or - 
Click the   button.  
2. In the Labels text box, enter the number of labels to be printed.  
3. Select the database tab. In the Records  field, select All records . 
4. Click OK. 
Printing using the form  
Variable data often needs to be entered by an operator just prior to printing. The program offers a 
quick and simple method of data entry: the form.  
Now that the form looks the way you want, we will launch printing.  
1. Go to File > Print  or press the F6  key. 
2. Enter ''2'' in the Labels field.  
3. Launch printing.  
The form is displayed, and you can enter the data to be printed.  
4. Enter '' Smith '' and ''51'', then click OK . 
After the first label is printed, the form is displayed again.  
5. Enter '' Mullang '' and ''52 '', then click OK . 
Note : The form is displayed for each label contained in the series. If you choose the For each series  
option, the form will only be displayed once, when printing of the label series is launched.  
To summarize  
The Print dialog box 
contains differences...  When the label contains a counter, the Labels field allows you to specify the 
number of different labels in a series.  
The Copies of each label  field allows you to define the number of copies of 
the same label to be printed.  
When the label does not include a counter, the Copies of each label  field 
serves the same purpose as the Labels  field.  
Copies of each page  A page copy can only be created if the label does not include an ISO 
counter and if the page contains more than one label.  
Print Merge  The Print Merge  prints all the records in a database, and this option is only 
available when the label is connected to a database.  
Printing usi ng the Form  The form allows an operator to enter data by keyboard just prior to printing.  

Printing  
55 Troubleshooting  
The table below lists the problems most frequently encountered during printing, and offers some 
solutions to help you resolve them.  
Problem  Cause  Solution  
Nothing is printed  The printer is not plugged in.  Plug the printer in.  
  For a parallel link: The printer is not 
configured for a parallel link.  Make sure that this setting has been configured 
in the printer control panel (refer to the printer 
manufacturer’s manual).  
  For a serial link: The serial 
communication settings are incorrect.  Make sure that the communication settings 
between the PC and the printer are the same (for 
the serial communication settings required by the 
printer, refer to the printer manufacturer’s 
manual).  
  The serial cable is not suitable.  Make sure that the cable matches the 
specifications of your printer (refer to the printer 
manufacturer’s manual).  
  In both cases (serial or parallel): The 
cable is connected to the wrong port.  Check the connection.  
  In both cases (serial or parallel): The 
cable is connected to the wrong port.  Check the connection.  
A page is not printed  For direct thermal printing: The print 
media has been inserted the wrong 
way (the print head is heating the 
wrong side of the paper).  Reinsert the media the right way.  
  For thermal transfer printing: The 
ribbon has not been inserted, or was 
inserted incorrectly.  Check the ribbon and refit if necessary (refer to 
the printer manufact urer’s manual).  
  The required print mode has not been 
selected on the printer.  Check that the print mode (thermal or thermal 
transfer) has been correctly selected on the printer (refer to the printer manufacturer’s 
manual) or in the Printer Setup  dialog box.  
A graphic object 
(image, Windows font, 
graphic barcode, etc.) 
has not been printed.  The printer is out of memory.  Check the Clear memory at next print time 
only option; If the problem persists, check the 
amount of memory space allocated to images (on the Images tab of your printer driver).  
User Guide  
56   The printer does not have enough 
memory.  Increase the amount of printer memory either by 
adding an extra memory card, or by increasing 
the RAM (refer to the printer manufacturer’s 
manual or check with the dealer who sold you 
the printer).  
The thermal printer is 
jammed  The print media used is not the same 
as the one defined in the Page setup  
dialog box (continuous paper or with gap).  Check that the right print media was selected 
during page setup: Continuous , With gap .
