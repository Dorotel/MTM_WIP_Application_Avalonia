Infor is not responsible for data incorrectly entered to the database through the use of the API 
Toolkit. Customers must establish a full test environment to ensure that data created by APIs 
functions in the same manner as data created through the VISUAL i nterface.  
 
  
Infor VISUAL API Toolkit  Development Guide | 7 Chapter 1  Introduction  1  
 
 
The Infor VISUAL API Toolkit is an Application Program Interface (API) designed to allow software 
developers the ability to interface with Infor VISUAL with their own custom code.  
The toolkitâs design consists of three layers: Data Management, Data Logic, and Business Logic. The data management layer provides portable data handling to either an SQL Server or Oracle database engine. The data logic layer provides document, transaction, and services handling on the 
server side. The business logic layer provides document, transaction, and services handling on the 
client side.  
Compatibility 
The toolkit is written in the Microsoft .NET framework. The toolkit is compatible with both version 4.0 
& 4.5 of the .Net Framework.  
Infor VISUAL 8.0.0  or higher is supported when using this toolkit. No other versions of VISUAL or 
other VISUAL products are compatible with the toolkit.  
If you use Oracle, then these specific components must be present:  
â¢ Oracle.ManagedDataAccess.dll  
â¢ Oracle.ManagedDataAccessDTC.dll  
Supported languages  
These languages are supported for use with the toolkit:  
â¢ Visual Basic 
â¢ C# 
While it is possible to use any .NET -aware programming language with the toolkit, other languages 
are not officially supported. For more information, see Support information .  
Introduction  
8 | Infor VISUAL API Toolkit  Development Guide  Development environment  
To interface with the API, developers can write their code in the C# or Visual Basic programming 
languages. All code samples in this document are provided in C#. Developers can interpolate to 
Visual Basic  as necessary . 
You must use a version of Microsoft Visual Studio that is capable of building to version 4 or higher of 
the Microsoft .NET framework. The minimum version of Visual Studio supported is version 2010 
Service Pack 1. Microsoft offers several editions of Visual  Studio such as Express, Professional, 
Premium, etc. All editions work with the API.  
All DLLs in the toolkit are built as 32 bit (x86) assemblies. Any programs you develop to interface 
with these assemblies must also be built as 32 bit. 64 bit or âAny CPUâ builds will not work. To 
configure Visual Studio for x86 builds, select the solution in the Solution Explorer, right click and 
select âConfiguration Managerâ. In the configuration manager dialog, create two x86 configurations: 
one for debug and one for release.  
Class library reference documents  
The class library reference documents list the documents, collections, transactions, and services 
used in each library. The documents provide samp le code in C# and Visual Basic.

Infor VISUAL API Toolkit  Development Guide | 11 Chapter 2  Coding with the Toolkit  2  
 
 
This section describes the elements that are required in your custom code. The section also 
presents an overview of the business objects and calling methods you can use.  
Calling conventions for business objects  
This section describes how your user interface should call the business objects.  
The Data Management  layer of the API is stored in a single library called LsaCore.DLL. 
LsaCore houses these namespaces:  
â¢ Lsa.Data  
â¢ Lsa.DataLogic  
â¢ Lsa.BusinessLogic  
Common Helper methods of the API are stored in a single library called LsaShared.DLL. 
LsaShared houses this namespace:  
â¢ Lsa.Shared  
Since LsaCoreâs and LsaSharedâs classes serve as the base from which all VISUAL  Business Logic 
Libraries are derived, you must reference all four in each of your programs.  In addition, you must set 
up âreferencesâ in your project(s) to LsaCore.DLL and LsaShared.DLL.  This C# code snippet 
illustrates integration of the LsaCore and LsaShared namespaces:  
namespace TestInventory 
{ 
        using System;  
   using System.Diagnostics; 
   using System.EnterpriseServices; 
   using System.Text; 
   using System.IO; 
   using Lsa.Data;  
Coding with the Toolkit  
12 | Infor VISUAL API Toolkit  Development Guide     using Lsa.BusinessLogic; 
using Lsa.DataLogic; 
using Lsa.Shared; 
Note the references to the namespaces prefaced by âSystemâ. These are also required, but you 
typically do not need to manually add these references. These references are built into Microsoftâs 
Visual Studio.  
To add references to your project for Lsa.Data, Lsa.BusinessLogic, Lsa.DataLogic, and Lsa.Shared:  
1 Locate the references header for your project in the Solution Explorer.  
2 Right click the header and select âadd reference.â  
3 Browse for the locations of LsaCore.DLL and LsaShared.DLL and select LsaCore.DLL and 
LsaShared.DLL  
4 Click OK.  
The Business Logic layer of the toolkit is stored in multiple libraries, one library for each general 
business function group within VISUAL.   
Library Name  Description  
VmfgSales. dll Customers, Customer Orders, Shipping, etc.  
VmfgPurchasing. dll Vendors, Purchase Orders, Purchase Order Receipts, etc.  
VmfgInventory. dll Parts, Inventory Adjustments and Transfers, etc.  
VmfgShopFloor. dll Labor Tickets, etc.  
VmfgFinancials. dll Payables, Receivables, etc.  
VmfgTrace.dll  Trace and Trace Profile  
VmfgShared. dll Common functionality shared by all of the above libraries.  
In addition to the mandatory references to LsaCore, LsaShared  described above, add references to 
VmfgShared  and one or more of the other Business Logic Libraries, depending on what type of 
business logic your program will perform. This table shows which libraries are needed based on 
business logic to be performed.  When in doubt, add references to all Vmfg  libraries.  
Functionality  Required References  
Sales  VmfgSales, VmfgInventory, VmfgShared.  
Purchasing  VmfgPurchasing, VmfgInventory, VmfgShared.  
Inventory  VmfgInventory, VmfgShared  
Shop Floor  VmfgShopFloor, VmfgInventory, VmfgShared  
Financials  VmfgFinancials, VmfgShared 
All  VmfgShared  
Coding with the Toolkit  
Infor VISUAL API Toolkit  Development Guide | 13 The API makes extensive use of Microsoft's ADO.NET.  If you are not familiar with ADO.NET 
datasets, you should obtain a reference guide to ADO.NET and the use of the dataset object.  
Many entry points, or methods, return ADO.NET Datasets. Datasets provide a table/row/column 
metaphor to manipulating data in a database. All of the methods defined in VISUAL business objects 
that return datasets, return them in a disconnected state. This m eans you may use the data and 
even change the content of the dataset, but you must return the dataset to the business object for 
storage and handling. You cannot update the database directly; i.e., all methods on the dataset that 
imply re -reading the data or writing to the database will return errors.  
This C# snippet illustrates the calling syntax for developing a simple Part Maintenance routine that 
adds a part to the database.  
Part part = new Part(instanceName); 
DataRow dr = null;  
part.Load(""); 
dr = part.NewPartRow(partID); 
dr["DESCRIPTION"] = "DOTNET PART #1 Description"; 
dr["STOCK_UM"] = "EA"; 
dr["PRIMARY_WHS_ID"] = "MMC- MAIN"; 
dr["PRIMARY_LOC_ID"] = "AREA1"; 
part.Save(); 
In this example, we load a Part with null ID. This gives us a dataset with a blank schema for a Part 
data object.  
Since we want to add a row to the Part data object, we initialize a new DataRow by calling the 
NewPartRow method of Part and passing the ID of the new Part. We then set the values of the 
various data row columns, and then we execute the Save method to plac e the data in the database.  
Database c onnections  
Before your customized code can interact with any of the API Toolkitâs business logic libraries, you 
must first have a valid connection to a VISUAL Enterprise database. All database connectivity 
information is stored in an XML file named DATABASE.CONFIG. Y ou can store an unlimited number 
of licensed VISUAL Enterprise databases in the configuration file.  
Use the Infor VISUAL API Toolkit Database Registration applet to register your VISUAL database. 
The applet is located in the same directory as your other VISUAL executables. See the Infor VISUAL 
API Toolkit Database Registration Guide.  
The toolkit supports only one Instance Group, and the Instance Group name must be set to 
â_defaultâ as in the example. If you use the applet to register databases, the instance name is equal 
to the database name. If you prefer to use a different instance n ame, you can change the instance 
Coding with the Toolkit  
14 | Infor VISUAL API Toolkit  Development Guide  name in the DATABASE.CONFIG file. In the sample, the instance name is âVMFGâ and the 
database name is âVMFGâ. The user name for all databases should be set to âSYSADMâ, the default 
database owner for all VISUAL databases. Also note that the SYSADM password is encrypted when 
stored in the configuration file. It will be decrypted by the API data layer at connection time.  
The DATABASE.CONFIG  file created by the VmfgConfigForms.exe applet also stores the path to 
the executable directory. This path is used if your database uses average costing or if your database 
generates BODs for integration to other products.  
To execute a connection to the database, you execute the OpenLocal  method of Dbms . Since 
Dbms  is a static object, you do not create (instantiate) it. You execute its methods directly.  
For example, to connect to the Sql Server database using the configuration in the sample, you would call OpenLocal  with these parameters:  
Dbms.OpenLocal(âVMFGâ, âSYSADMâ, âthe sysadm passwordâ)  
You should open the database connection early in your programâs execution, and hold on to the 
connection until the program terminates.  
Single sign-on 
The API Toolkit supports single sign-on. In single sign- on, Windows login credentials are used to 
connect to the VISUAL database. Before you can use single sign- on with the API toolkit, complete 
these tasks:  
â¢ Enable single sign- on in VISUAL.  
â¢ Add Windows users as VISUAL users.  
After you complete these tasks, you can execute a connection to the database by using the 
OpenLocalSSO  method of Dbms . This method requires that the Windows user information be 
passed in as parameters. The user information can be obtained using the 
Lsa.Shared.GetSingleSignOnData  class. Once instantiated, this class will collect the required data 
for the Windows user that is currently logged in. This data can then be passed to the OpenLocalSSO  method to execute the database connection.  
For example, you would this code  to connect to the database using Single Sign On in the API:  
Lsa.Shared.GetSingleSignOnData sso = new Lsa.Shared.GetSingleSignOnData(); 
 
string domain = sso.DomainName; 
string domainSID = sso.DomainSID; 
string userName = sso.UserName; 
string userSID = sso.UserSID; 
 
Dbms.OpenLocalSSO(âVMFGâ, username, userSID, domain, domainSID) 
Coding with the Toolkit  
Infor VISUAL API Toolkit  Development Guide | 15 Saving your code  
In order for your code to function properly, your code, the API DLLs, and the DATABASE.CONFIG 
file must be located in the same directory.  If you develop code using Open Text Team Developer, an 
additional copy of the DATABASE.CONFIG file must also be located in the Team Developer development folder.  
Managing objects  
Each type of object in the database is represented in one of four types of objects in the business logic libraries.  
The database uses these types of objects:  
Documents  
A header and one or more subordinate records, which may have their own subordinate records. Example: A Customer Order.  
Collections  
Multiple rows of the same type of record generally having no subordinate records. Collections are 
a subset of Documents (i.e. there is no separate Collections base class). Example: Product 
Codes.  
Transactions  
A typically audited change to the database that usually affects multiple tables and often multiple 
data spaces. Example: A Labor Ticket.  
Services  
Information is returned to the caller, with no changes to the database having occurred. Example: A 
Unit of Measure Conversion.  
Each of the objects is managed in a different way. Documents are handled one at a time. Collections typically work on all rows of a table at once. Transactions cause multiple changes and/or additions to 
the database.  
Generally, all business objects have a Load command and a Save command. These two methods 
are used to access and modify the data. Transactions and services are available by calling the 
Prepare command. Documents and Collections are available by calling the Load command. One 
difference between a Document and a Collection is the signature of the Load command. Documents 
require you to specify a primary key. Collections return the entire result set. Services are initiated by 
calling Prepare, just as Transaction s are. The Execute command (rather than Save as in 
Transactions) execute them, and the result set returned to the caller contains the requested 
information. This table shows all standard entry points exposed by the business logic libraries, which 
object ty pes they apply to, and a brief description.  
Coding with the Toolkit  
16 | Infor VISUAL API Toolkit  Development Guide  Method  Used By  Description / Comments  
Load  Documents, Collections  Load retrieves an existing document or collection 
data from th e database.  
For documents, specify the primary key of the 
document to process. If you pass a null or 
nonexistent key value to Load , a blank schema is 
returned. Use this blank schema as  the starting 
point  for inserting a new document.  
For collections, keys are optional. Providing no key 
will cause the lo ading of all rows of the table.  If a 
key is provided, only the matching single row is 
returned.  
Save  Documents, Collections, 
Transactions  Save provides the entry point designed to r ecord 
changes to the database. All data changes are 
requested through this method.  The call to save 
takes no arguments.  
Prepare  Transactions, Services  Prepare return s an empty dataset corresponding to 
the particular tran saction or service being used.  
The definition of this dataset is determined by the 
data object. Refer  to the written documentation for 
this definition as there is no way to obtain this 
information via a browsing tool. Your program will 
populate a row or rows in this dataset, which in turn 
will be processed when the transaction is saved or 
the service is e xecuted.  
Execute  Services  Execute cause s the requested service to be run. It 
is conceptually similar to S ave; however, services 
never update the database . Services return the 
requested information.  
Exists  Documents, Collections  Exists provides a way of determining if a row with 
the provided logical key exists in the database.  
Find Documents, Collections  Find is conceptually similar to Load.  Unlike Load, 
which loads the entire data hierarchy of a 
document, Find only loads the top level table of the 
hierarchy.  
Browse  Documents  Browse is method of retrieving  a set of top level 
rows. Ideal for providing lists for the user. It returns 
a dataset containing a single table having the same 
name as the documentâs top level table. Similar to 
Find, except it returns multiple rows. All Browses 
have two modes, parameter -less (returning all rows) 
and limited to a specified number of rows.   
Coding with the Toolkit  
Infor VISUAL API Toolkit  Development Guide | 17 Method  Used By  Description / Comments  
Newâ¦Row  Documents, Transactions, 
Services  Adds a new row to an in memory datasetâs data 
table that was previously initialized via a Load or 
Prepare.  
General query 
Because there may be times where your application needs to obtain data from the database for 
which there is no appropriate entry point available through the existing business logic library methods (i.e. Load, Browse, Find, etc.), a General Query interface is provided through the 
VmfgShared  library.  It is not possible to perform updates to the data through this interface.  
General Query will return an ADO.NET Data Table containing all of the resultant rows from the query.  
This code snippet illustrates usage of General Query:  
GeneralQuery query = null;    
query = new GeneralQuery(databaseInstanceName); 
query.Prepare("INVENTORY", "select QTY from VMFG.PART_LOCATION where PART_ID 
= ?  and WAREHOUSE_ID = 'MMC- MAIN'  and LOCATION_ID = 'AREA1' "); 
query.Parameters[0] = partID;          
query.Execute(); 
     
foreach (DataRow tempRow in query.Tables["INVENTORY"].Rows) { 
 onHandQty += tempRow.ToDecimal("QTY"); 
} query.Dispose(); 
 
An instance of the GeneralQuery class is initialized and set to the variable named query.  
The Prepare method of query is called, passing a table name, and a string representing the query to 
be executed. Note the table name in the first parameter is the name of the results table, and can be set to any value you desire.  
The queryâs parameters are set, in this case the part ID is the only parameter.  
The query is executed by executing queryâs Execute method.  
A foreach loop is entered for the purposes of processing each row of the results table.  
Finally, the Dispose method is called to free all resources associated with this query. This is 
mandatory, since only one GeneralQuery may be active at any given time.

18 | Infor VISUAL API Toolkit  Development Guide  Sample s olutions  
Most  sample s are  provided in both C# and Visual Basic.  You can find the samples in the 
VMFGSAMPLESAPITOOLKIT. zip file located in the patch release download. You can find the patch 
release download in the Downloads section of Infor Xtreme.   
Note:  By default, the API toolkit DLLs are located in the same folder as your VISUAL executables.  
To use the sample code in a test environment, configure a valid connection to a VISUAL database 
using the configuration applet (VmfgConfigForms.EXE). You can use the applet to configure and test 
a database connection. We recommend you configure a connectio n before using the samples.  
In order for the samples to function properly, the samples, the DLLs, and the DATABASE.CONFIG 
file must be located in the same directory. If you use Open Text Team Developer as the user 
interface with the API toolkit, you must have an additional copy of the DATABASE.CONFIG in the 
Team Developer development folder.  
The first time you open any of the sample solutions, you will need to reset the project references to 
point to the exact location of the APIs on your system. If you open the Solution Explorer, select the 
project, then expand the References node, you should see a list similar to this:  
Note the four entries with the warning icon next to them. These will have to be reapplied. For 
example, for LsaCore, right click LsaCore, then click Remove. Then right click References, and 
select Add Referenceâ¦ .  Browse to the location of âLsaCore.DLLâ and select it to be added.

Infor VISUAL API Toolkit  Development Guide | 19 Visual Studio 2013 samples 
Samples are provided in C# and Visual Basic. If you are using a version of Visual Studio newer than 
2013, you may need to upgrade your samples to the newer Visual Studio format. You are informed 
of the need to upgrade the sample solution the first time you load it in Visual Studio. Follow the 
upgrade wizard, accepting all defaults, and your code will be converted and ready to use in the 
upgraded Visual Studio format . 
These samples are provided in the Sales folder :  
â¢ TestDocuments. Use this sample to review the use of toolkit B usiness Documents . With this 
sample, users can create customers and customer orders.  Note that the sample shows a 
minimal number of columns being populated. Also note that there is a one- to-one relationship 
between the tables and columns in the Business Document Dataset and the actual database 
schema. For example, to set the desired ship date of an order, you would use the column name 
âDESIRED_SHIP_DATEâ in your program, since this is the name in the database.   
â¢ TestTransactions. Use this sample to review the use of toolkit Business Transactions. With this 
sample, users can ship a customer order and receive a return of a customer order. Unlike Business Documents where the schema in the program matches the database schema, the 
schema for the Transaction input must be obtained from the written documentation. Please refer to the class library reference documents. These documents list all supported Transactions in a 
particular class library, their columns, and whether the columns are required or optional.   
These samples are provided  in the ShopFloor folder :  
â¢ LaborEntryApp. Use this sample to review  using  the API Toolkit in conjunction with a web 
interface to create a labor ticket . Note: This sample is provided to prove the concept that a Web 
UI can be used with the toolkit. Infor cannot assist you with developing a Web  UI. For more 
information, see Supported languages .  
â¢ TestWorkOrders. Use this sample to review a more complex use of the API toolkit. With this sample, users can add an operation and a leg to a work order.  
Visual Studio 2015 sample 
The VmfgAddIn sample shows how to use the APIs to load data from VISUAL into a Microsoft Excel 
spreadsheet and how to add data from the spreadsheet into VISUAL. This is intended for the loading 
of static data tables not requiring subordinate table data. This sample was created using Visual 
Studio  2015 and can interact with current versions of Excel and Microsoft Office.  
Team Developer samples 
Note: Infor does not officially support the use of Team Developer with the toolkit. The samples are 
provided to prove the concept that any .NET -aware language can be used with the toolkit. For more 
information, see Supported languages . 
 
Coding with the Toolkit  
20 | Infor VISUAL API Toolkit  Development Guide  These samples are provided in Team Developer 6.2 and 7.0:  
â¢ Test API . This sample i s the TestDocuments sample written in Team Developer.  
â¢ Customer Orders.  This sample shows how to use the APIs to create an application with a 
similar look and feel as VISUAL applications. It includes a main form for entering in the customer 
document information such as entity, site, currency IDs, as well as a sold to address and 
customer contact information. A sales order form is available from the toolbar menu that allow s 
users to create customer orders.  
 
  
Infor VISUAL API Toolkit  Development Guide | 21 Chapter 3  Documents  3  
 
 
Access a document by calling Load on the object that manages the document. Load will accept the 
logical key of the document and will return a dataset containing the entire data hierarchy for the 
matching logical key. If a document matching the provided key  is not found, a dataset is returned 
having no tables or rows, but containing the complete logical definition (schema) for the data 
hierarchy.  
The dataset returned is an ADO.NET dataset, which is essentially an in- memory database 
containing all of the elements of a traditional database such as tables, rows, and columns.  
Standard entry m ethods  
You can use these standard entry methods with documents:  
â¢ Load  
â¢ Save 
â¢ Exists 
â¢ Find 
â¢ Browse 
â¢ Newâ¦Row  
Sample  
This sample code loads a part by part ID. If the part ID is not in the database, then the part is added 
to the database. If the part does exist, then the information for the part in the database is updated.  
In the sample code, txtPartID is a screen- hosted variable.  
The sample uses the Load, Newâ¦Row, and Save methods.  
Part part = new Part(databaseInstanceName); 
DataRow dr; 
Documents  
22 | Infor VISUAL API Toolkit  Development Guide  part.Load(txtPartID); 
if (part.Rows.Count = 0) { 
 dr = part.NewPartRow(txtPartID); 
} 
else { 
 dr = part.Row; 
} 
 
// set the part row values here 
 
part.Save(); 
This loads the part identified by the txtPartID screen variable.  
If this part exists, part.Rows.Count  will be greater than 0. The part is returned along with several 
sub-tables, such as the PART_ALIAS table, the PART_SUBSTITUTE table, the 
PART_CROSS_SELLING table, and other related tables.  
If the part does not exist (i.e. the part.Rows.Count  equals 0), then a call to NewPartRow  is used to 
add a new part to the database.  
Regardless of whether you are adding a new part or updating an existing one, you finalize the 
document by executing part.Save().  
To delete a row, you must execute the Delete method on the data row prior to executing Save.  For 
example:  
dr.Delete(); 
 
Binary data  
Many VISUAL d ocuments allow you to store long text data that coincides with that document.  There 
is virtually no limit to the length of this data.  For example, with Customer Orders, you can store long 
text at both the header and line item levels. This data is stored in the database in binary format, thus 
it is not human- readable as stored. In order to store human- readable text in these binary columns , 
your program must first convert this data to a Unicode byte array.  
We will be expanding the previous example. This code snippet illustrates how you would convert 
your long text prior to saving it to the database:  
dr = part.NewPartBinaryRow(partID, "D"); 
            dr["BITS"] = System.Text. Encoding .Unicode.GetBytes("LONG PART BINARY TEXT FOR 
" + partID);  
 
Documents  
Infor VISUAL API Toolkit  Development Guide | 23 Note the second parameter to âNewPartBinaryRow()â. It is set to âDâ to indicate âDataâ. Although the 
VISUAL  supports other types, the Toolkit only supports type âDâ.  
Your program treats the text to be inserted as a string. A system function is called to convert this 
string to a byte array. The value of the byte array data column (âBITSâ) is set to this converted value.  
Auto numbering of documents:  
VISUAL uses the concept of âauto numberingâ the IDs of many types of documents. In the standard 
VISUAL user interface, the user supplies as much information on the window as needed to save the 
document and leaves the ID field blank.  When save is executed, the next available ID in the series 
for that particular document type is assigned.   
The toolkit also supports auto numbering. Because ADO.NET does not allow a null primary key, you 
must use a placeholder ID to prompt auto- numbering. Any ID supplied in the format of â<n>â  (where 
n is any integer value) is treated as a request to auto number. This example illustrates adding a new 
Customer Order using auto- numbering:  
CustomerOrder custOrder = new  CustomerOrder(databaseInstanceName); 
custOrder.Load(ââ); DataRow drHeader = custOrder.NewOrderRow(â<1>â); 
//set drHeader columns to valid values here 
custOrder.Save();

Infor VISUAL API Toolkit  Development Guide | 25 Chapter 4  Collections  4  
 
 
Since Collections are similar to Documents, this section only describes the differences between 
Collections and Documents.  
Collections almost never have transactions and are not automatically numbered. In some cases, Collections may even be read- only. The methods defined for a Collection reflect their design.  
The most notable difference in the way Collections work is the Load method. When you Load a Collection, you can load all of the rows (the entire table), or just a specific row. Since most collections are designed to have a somewhat limited number of rows, and usually you would like to 
present all of these rows to the user in some sort of list or data grid, you typically load the entire 
collection at once. A deciding factor in whether something becomes a Collection in the business objects is how it is typically maintained in a user interface. If it is common to work on multiple rows at 
a time, the object will most likely be a Collection.  
Standard entry m ethods  
You can use these standard entry methods with collections:  
â¢ Load  
â¢ Save 
â¢ Exists 
â¢ Find 
Sample  
This sample code loads the entire contents of the Product Code data collection.  
The sample uses the Load method.  
ProductCodes productCodes = new ProductCodes(databaseInstanceName); 
ProductCode.Load(); 
Collections  
26 | Infor VISUAL API Toolkit  Development Guide  foreach(DataRow dataRow in productCodes.Rows) { 
 //do something with the data 
 //in this example we are just writing each code to the screen 
 Debug.WriteLine(dataRow[âCODEâ]); 
}   
At this point, the dataset has all of the product codes in the table. You would most likely present 
them in the user interface in a grid.  
  
Infor VISUAL API Toolkit  Development Guide | 27 Chapter 5  Transactions  5  
 
 
Transactions are defined by business objects. If a business object possesses the Prepare and Save 
methods, it has transactions.  
You cannot identify supported t ransactions  by examining the VISUAL software. Definitions of all 
transac tions must be obtained from the reference document s. Transactions belong to particular 
classes in each library. At this time, you can find descriptions of transaction in these reference 
documents:  
â¢ Infor VISUAL API Toolkit Inventory Class Library Reference  
â¢ Infor VISUAL API Toolkit Purchasing Class Library Reference  
â¢ Infor VISUAL API Toolkit Sales Class Library Reference  
â¢ Infor VISUAL API Toolkit Shop Floor Class Library Reference  
You use Prepare to obtain a dataset that contains a table or tables with column definitions pertaining to a particular type of transaction. The transactions available to you in the client program are strictly controlled by the design of each business objec t. 
When the prepared dataset is returned, it is empty. After you add rows, you use the Save method to process the rows.  
Standard entry m ethods  
You can use these standard entry methods with transactions:  
â¢ Prepare  
â¢ Save 
â¢ Newâ¦Row  
Sample  
This sample code adds Adjust In  inventory transactions.  
Transactions  
28 | Infor VISUAL API Toolkit  Development Guide  This sample uses the Prepare, Newâ¦Row, and Save methods , where multiple transactions are 
generated, and each transaction is saved individually .  
InventoryTransaction inv = new InventoryTransaction(instancename); 
Inv.Prepare(); foreach (GridRow gridrow in myDataGrid) 
{ 
DataRow dataRow = inv.NewInputRow(); dataRow[âENTRY_NOâ] = 1; 
dataRow[âTRANSACTION_TYPEâ] = âADJUST_INâ; 
dataRow[âQTYâ] = gridRowQty;  
dataRow[âPART_IDâ] = gridRowPartID;  
dataRow[âTO_WAREHOUSE_IDâ] = gridRowWarehouseID; 
dataRow[âTO_LOCATION_IDâ] = gridRowLocation;  
inv.Save(); dataRow.Tables[0].Clear(); 
} 
Note the setting of the column âENTRY_NOâ to 1 in the example.  For most transactions, 
ENTRY_NO is the primary key to the transactionâs data table. Since it is possible to submit multiple 
transaction rows to the Save method, each data row must have a unique primary key. For example, 
if you were to send two rows to be saved, the first row would have ENTRY_NO = 1 and the second 
row would have ENTRY_NO = 2.  It is your programâs responsibility to set unique values for 
ENTRY_NO.  Since some transactions may consist of multiple data tables, the ENTRY_NO also 
provides a convenient way to link top level tables with their subordinates.  
In the above example, since each row in the grid is producing an inventory transaction via a loop, the 
input data row must be clear ed after each save. Otherwise, the number of rows in the input table will 
continue to increase on each pass through the loop, resulting in too many inventory transactions 
being created when Save() is executed.  
It is possible to pass multiple transaction rows to a single execution of Save.  However, passing too 
many rows simultaneously may cause performance problems.  Each Save is treated as a logic unit of 
work. Thus, the entire âbatchâ is treated as one transaction on the database engine.  A transaction 
consisting of a large number of input rows could tie up the database managerâs system resources and potentially cause other userâs transactions to wait. If you decide to process multiple rows 
simultaneously, you may  need to experiment on your system to determine the optimal number of 
rows per batc h. 
This example shows another method for inputting multiple rows into a transaction input table and then executing a single s ave. Note : The Save() method is executed only once, outside of the loop 
and there is no clearing of the input table. In this example, the input table has  one row for each grid 
row in the loop.

dataRow[âPART_IDâ] = gridRowPartID; 
dataRow[âTO_WAREHOUSE_IDâ] = gridRowWarehouseID;

Infor VISUAL API Toolkit  Development Guide | 31 Chapter 6  Services  6  
 
 
Services are defined by business objects. If a business object possesses both the Prepare and 
Execute methods, it is capable of executing services.  
The behavior of Services is completely defined by the business logic implementation. They are provided as a tool for retrieving useful information from the database that otherwise may be difficult or cumbersome to obtain using straight calls to the Data Manager, since they often require fetching 
data from numerous sources and/or performing calculations. Services are similar to Transactions in 
that they both are initialized via the Prepare method. Services, unlike Transactions, are executed by the Execute method rather than the Save method, and they do not  perform any database updates.  
You cannot identify supported services by examining the VISUAL software. Definitions of all supported s ervices mus t be obtained from the reference guides. At this time, all services are 
documented in the Infor VISUAL API Shared Class Library Reference. 
You use Prepare to obtain a dataset with column definitions pertaining to the service you are executing. The services available to you in the client program are strictly controlled by the design of 
each business object.  
The dataset returned after the Prepare method has two tables: a header table and a results table. Populate the header table with the parameters to pass to the service for execution. The results table 
is populated by the execution of the service and returned to you. Using the question and answer metaphor, the header table contains the âquestionâ and the results table contains the âanswer.â

Services  
32 | Infor VISUAL API Toolkit  Development Guide  Sample  
This sample converts a quantity measured in one unit to a quantity measured in a second unit. The 
Prepare, Newâ¦Row, and Execute methods are used.  
UnitOfMeasureConversion um = new 
UnitofMeasureConversion(databaseInstanceName); 
um.Prepare();      
DataRow inputRow = um.NewInputRow(1); 
inputRow["PART_ID"] = partID; 
inputRow["FROM_UM"] = dataRow["SELLING_UM"]; 
inputRow["TO_UM"] = dataRow["VMFG:PART:STOCK_UM"]; 
inputRow["FROM_QTY"] = dataRow["USER_ORDER_QTY"]; 
um.Execute(); 
DataTable conversions =(DataTable)um.Tables["CONVERT_UM_RESULT"];   
  
DataRow conversionRow = (DataRow)conversions.Rows[0];     
orderQty = conversionRow.ToDecimal("TO_QTY"); 
An Instance of UnitofMeasure is initialized and stored in a variable named âumâ. Prepare() is called 
to access the dataset containing the header table. A new row is inserted into the header table via a 
call to NewInputRow(). The new rowâs column values are populated.  
The service is Executed.  
The results table is extracted from the um dataset, and the first row from this table is accessed. The 
variable orderQty is set to a value from the results row.
