information you define in Application Global Maintenance in Accounting Entity Maintenance or Site 
Maintenance. 
Information defined at the tenant level includes:
• Certain application-wide information, such as purchase quote type, the default directory for
documents, and interface theme
• Common codes, such as Honorifics, Packaging Types, Carriers, Workflow Codes, Commodity
Codes, and Units of Measure

Complex Expressions
You can combine simple calls for data from the database with expressions that convert the data to a 
different format or prompt the system to choose between two values. You can use these expressions:
@FORMATNUMBER  – Use this expression to change the format of a number. You can specify the 
number of decimal places and the separator characters you use. To use the expression, specify the 
number you would like to convert, then specify the format. For example:
@FORMATNUMBER (1235,99, “#,##0”) would convert 1235,99 to 1,235.
Specifying Other Default Information
2 – 30 | Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide @FORMATDATE  – Use this expression to change the format of a date. To use the expression, 
specify the date you would like to convert, then specify the format. For example:
@FORMATDATE (2010-07-14, “mm/dd/yyyy”) would convert 2010-07-14 to 07/14/2010.
@UTCDATE  – Use this expression to change the format of a date into universal time coordinate 
(UTC) format. To use the expression, specify the date you would like to convert, specify if you would 
like to show the time, and specify if you would like to show the duration. To specify whether or not to 
show the time or offset, use True to show the time or offset and False to not show the time or offset. 
For example, 
@UTCDATE (2010-07-14, TRUE, FALSE) would convert 2010-07-14 to 2010-07-
14T16.25.54.18z. If you specified @UTCDATE (2010-07-14, TRUE, TRUE), the date would 
convert to 2010-07-14T16:25:54.18Z-04:00.
@ROUND  – Use this expression to round a fractional number to a specific number of decimal places. 
To use this expression, specify the number you would like to round followed by the precision and 
scale.  Precision is the number of digits in the number; scale is the number of digits after the decimal 
point. For example:
@ROUND (6543.1267, 6, 2) will convert 6543.1267 to 6543.13. If you specified @ROUND 
(6543.1267, 5, 2), 6543.1267 would be converted to 6543.1 Since the number is limited to 5 digits 
in the definition, the system would only include one digit after the decimal point.
 @LOOKUP – Use this expression to retrieve a cross-referenced value from the database. To use the 
expression, specify the key, table, keyfield, and datafield. For example, 
@LOOKUP (‘CURRENCY_ID’, ‘CURRENCY’, ‘ID’, ‘ISO_CODE’) would retrieve the ISO code for 
the currency ID.
@SQL  – Use this expression to execute a simple select SQL statement against the database. For 
example:
@SQL (‘SELECT COMPANY_NAME FROM APPLICATION_GLOBAL’) would retrieve the 
company_name data from the application_global table.
@IF – Use this expression to ask the system to return one of two values based on the result of a test 
you specify. To use this expression, specify a test (for example, 1<2), the value the system returns if 
the test is true, and the value the system returns if the test is false. For example, 
@IF (1>2, ‘1 is greater than 2’, ‘1 is not greater than 2,’)  would return 1 is not greater than 2. The 
system would evaluate the test, 1>2, determine that the test is false (1 is less than 2), and return 
the value you specified for a false test, 1 is not greater than 2.
Concatenation
You can join simple expressions or string values and simple expressions together using a 
concatenation operator. The concatenation operator is a double pipe: ||. For example:
VEND_BANK_CITY || ’,’ || VEND_BANK_STATE || VEND_BANK_ZIPCODE would produce the 
vendor bank’s city, state and zip code in this format: Boston, MA 02123. In this example, the comma 
is a string value and the references to database columns are simple expressions.
Specifying Other Default Information
Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide | 2 – 31Other Functions
You may find these functions useful in your export file formats:
SalDateCurrent()  – Use this function to return the current date and time. You can use this function in 
conjunction with a complex expression to specify a format for the data. For example:
 @UTCDATE ( SalDateCurrent(), TRUE, FALSE) would return the current date expressed in UTC 
format without offset. For example, 2010-07-14T14:58:27.68Z.
SalStrLeftX( string, length)  – Use this function to return a portion of the string value you specify. For 
example:
SalStrLeftX (DESCRIPTION, 40) would return the first 40 characters in the DESCRIPTION 
database column.
SalStrTrimX (string)  – Use this function to remove all blanks from the string value. For example:
SalStrTrimX (COMPANY_NAME) would return MajesticManufacturingCompany instead of 
Majestic Manufacturing Company.
SalStrScan (string 1, string2)  – Use this function to find the value you specify for string2 in string1. 
For example:
SalStrScan (VENDOR_NAME, ‘Steel’) would return vendor names that included the word ‘steel’ .
SalNumberAbs (number)  – Use this function to return the absolute number.

Entering Address Layouts
Multiple address layouts are supported for use throughout VISUAL. You define address layouts by 
country. When you select the country in a window such as Customer Maintenance, the Country ID, 
name and address layout update to the country’s associated address layout. If you do not define a 
custom layout for a particular country, the default layout is used. 
Country Address Layout IDs correspond to their country descriptions. If you use the same country 
description with multiple Country IDs, you can use the same layout with more than one country. If a 
country has multiple Country IDs with unique country descriptions, you can have multiple layouts for 
that country. However, it is recommended that you maintain only one address layout per country by 
making it flexible enough to accommodate all potential formats for the country.
Note: If you type in a free-form description in the Country field and that description does not exist in 
the Countries table, the country description is created but it is not added to the Country table. To use 
the layout, users must manually specify it in the country description field in a maintenance window, 
such as Customer Maintenance.
Address layouts can be up to five lines and are made up of labels and data fields. The labels are 
displayed to the left of the data fields, and you can define one label for each line. You can use up to 
seven data fields. You can place any of the fields on any of the lines in any order.
Users can enter alphanumeric text into the any of the data fields. Field #9 uses the codes you defined 
in the States and Province table. 
To define an address layout:
1Select Admin , Application Global Maintenance .
2Select Maintain , Address Setup .
The default address layout is the conventional US address layout.
3To create a layout, specify an ID in the Country field. The ID must be the same as the Country for 
which this address layout is intended. For example, an address layout ID of Spain is required for 
an entity with a Country ID of Spain.

level. Information defined at the accounting entity level includes:
• Costing information, such as the costing method, POC revenue recognition method, and burden
basis
• Default VAT information
• Default Intrastat information
• Payment information, such as Next Payment Batch Sequence # and withholding information
• Default Order Management information, such as whether WIP/VAS is enabled, how the date of
the oldest outstanding invoice is determined, and allocation information
Information you define at the accounting entity level applies to each of the sites that belong to the 
entity.

Using the VAT Tab
Value-Added Tax (VAT) is a tax on consumed goods. While the total tax amount is ultimately paid by 
the customer who purchases the final product, a portion of the tax is collected any time goods or 
services are purchased.
For example, if a company buys two raw materials for the manufacture of a product, the company 
would pay VAT on the raw materials. When the final product is sold, the company is reimbursed for 
the taxes paid on the raw materials. 
VAT is not typically paid on exports.

3 – 6 | Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide Setting Up VAT Books
VAT Books control the numbering sequence of all invoices and memos created when VAT is enabled. 
In the European Community, there may be more than one “VAT book” or numbering sequence in use 
at any one time. With VAT enabled, more than one automatic number sequence can exist for invoices 
and memos.
Use VAT Book Setup to specify numbering sequences. You can set up numbering sequences for 
Accounts Payable Invoices, Accounts Payable Memos, Accounts Receivable Invoices, and Accounts 
Receivable Memos. After you set up numbering sequences in VAT Book Setup, you can assign the 
accounts receivable sequences to customers and accounts payable sequences to vendors. 
When you generate invoices for your customers, the invoice number is determined by the VAT Book 
code you assigned to the customer for invoices. If you issue a memo to a customer, the memo 
number is determined by the VAT book code you assigned to the customer for memos. 
If you create an invoice or memo manually, you must specify a VAT book code. If you create an 
invoice or memo manually, the VAT book code you specify does not need to match the VAT book 
code you specified on the customer or vendor record. 
VAT codes are also used in VAT reports and Intrastat reports.
To set up a VAT Book:

date on invoice 101.
If multiple users enter VAT transactions, you can specify a date in the Current Posting Date field 
to ensure that posting dates on transactions are entered correctly. 
5In the VAT Code Type section, specify the types of transactions to associate with the VAT book 
code. Select one or more of these check boxes:

declarations for distributors of goods who import and export within the EC.
Intrastat applies to the importation and exportation of goods. It does not apply to goods shipped within 
a given member country. Only VAT registered companies are required to provide Intrastat 
information.

destination is recorded in a permanent way. Periodically, each manufacturer and distributor of goods 
must report the items they sold and distributed, where they were manufactured or obtained, and 
where they were sent, including intermediate distribution points.

4 – 2 | Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide What are Sites?
Sites are specific physical locations that have their own parts, services, shop resources, and 
warehouses. Database users and employees are assigned to specific sites. Most of the transactions 
you enter are at the site level.
If you are licensed to use multiple sites, you can set up different information for each site. If you are 
licensed to use a single site, then you can set up information for your single site in Site Maintenance.
To set up basic information about sites, use Site Maintenance. You can:
• Create sites
• Set up general information, such as the site address, default packlist status, repetitive
manufacturing information, part location on the fly information, part warehouse on the fly
information, and issue negative information
• Set up scheduling information
• Set up shipment tracking information, such as shipment reason codes, default shipping label
information, and the partial shipments with pre-invoiced orders setting
• Set up ECN information
• Set up inventory and labor defaults, inspections defaults, and default project warehouse
information
• Assign existing parts, services, and shop resources to the site
• Maintain calendar exceptions
If you are licensed to use multiple sites, the system administrator can assign the site to database 
users. Assigned sites are referred to as allowable sites . Database users can choose which of their 
allowable sites they want to use. The sites database users choose to use are referred to as viewable 
sites.  If you are licensed to use a single site, all users should be assigned to the single site.
If you are licensed to use multiple sites, you also assign sites to employees in Employee 
Maintenance. Employees can enter labor tickets for any site they are allowed to use. If you are 
licensed to use a single site, all employees should be assigned to the single site.
Accessing Site Maintenance
Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide | 4 – 3Accessing Site Maintenance
To access Site Maintenance, select Admin , Site Maintenance .
Creating a Site
4 – 4 | Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide Creating a Site
Each site belongs to an accounting entity. Accounting entities can have multiple sites, but each site 
can belong to only one entity.
If you upgraded from a previous version, you defined one accounting entity ID for each of your 
financial entities during the upgrade process. Each financial entity ID becomes a site ID in the 
upgraded database.
If you have not exceeded the maximum number of sites allowed by your license, you can create 
additional sites. 
Before you can create a site, you must define its parent accounting entity. The accounting entity must 
have an entity currency assigned to it.
To create a site:
1Click New.
2Click the Entity ID  arrow and select the parent accounting entity for the site you are creating.
3In the Site ID field, specify a Site ID. We recommend that you do not  use single quotations (‘), 
forward slashes (/), or commas (,) in your site ID. Using these characters may result in reduced 
site selection functionality in reports and cause issues with integrations to other products through 
Infor10 Ion.
4Click Save.
Specifying General Site Information
Use the General tab to define basic information about your site.

4In the Repetitive section, specify information to use in the Material Planning Window. Specify this 
information:
Demand Fence 1 and 2  – Demand fences are used in conjunction with MRP. The values you 
specify in this section are used to order parts if the part has an order policy of Master Schedule, 
and the demand fence is not defined on the part’s record or on the product code for the part. The 
value is in days.

Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide | 4 – 5Use Fence 1 as MRP Frozen Period  – To prevent planned orders from being created during the 
demand fence period, select this check box. When you select this check box, planned orders 
cannot be created within the demand fence time period. Planned orders are generated after the 
time specified in demand fence 1 elapses. By using a frozen demand fence, you can prevent 
planned order from being generated in a time frame that is too short to actually supply the 
product.
Clear this check box to allow planned orders to be generated at any time.
5In the Part Location on the Fly section, select one of these options:
Not Allowed  – Select this option to prevent part locations from being assigned on the fly. You can 
only use existing part/location associations. You cannot create new part/location associations or 
unique warehouse locations at the time of transaction. With this setting, you must establish part/ 
location associations using the Part Maintenance window or the Part Location Creator.
Assign Existing Location to Part  – Select this option to allow users to assign an existing 
warehouse location to a part (an association that previously did not exist) at the time of a 
transaction. The warehouse location and part must already exist.
Create New Location and Assign to Part – Select this option to allow users to create a new 
warehouse location and assign it to a part, thereby creating a valid part/location association at the 
time of the transaction. The warehouse must already exist.
The part location on the fly setting applies to transactions created using:
• Inventory Transaction Entry (VMINVMNT.EXE)
This applies when you receive, issue, adjust, and transfer (only in To Warehouse Locations) 
part quantities and must specify a warehouse location into which you are receiving, 
transferring, issuing, or adjusting.
• Purchase Receipt Entry (VMRCVMNT.EXE)
This applies when you are receiving a purchase order quantity at a warehouse and can 
specify a location within the warehouse at the time of receipt.
• Shipping Entry (VMSHPENT.EXE) (returns only)
This applies when you are receiving a returned customer shipment at a warehouse and can 
specify a location within the warehouse at the time of return receipt.
• Physical Inventory Count (VMPHYINV.EXE)
This applies when you are conducting part counts and recounts within warehouses and can 
specify a location.
• Interbranch Transfer Shipping Entry (VMIBTSHP.EXE)
This applies when you are shipping an IBT from one warehouse (From Whse ID) location to 
another (To Whse ID) and can specify from which location to ship the parts.
• Interbranch Transfer Receipts Entry (VMIBTRCV.EXE)
This applies when you are receiving an IBT into a warehouse location (To Whse ID) and can 
specify into which location to receive the transfer.
When you create a new part/location association, you are prompted to specify a Hold Reason 
ID, Description, and a Status for the part in the new Warehouse Location.

is not available if you selected the Not Allowed option in the Part/Location on the Fly section.
7In the Issue Negative section, select from these combinations:
Warehouse cleared, Location cleared  – Use this combination to prevent both locations and 
warehouses from reaching a negative quantity.
Warehouse selected, Location selected  – Select both check boxes to allow individual 
warehouse locations to reach a negative quantity and to allow the warehouse to reach a negative 
quantity as well. The system behaves in the same manner as it does if you select only the 
Warehouse check box.
Warehouse cleared, Location selected  – Use this combination to allow warehouse locations to 
reach a negative quantity, but to prevent the warehouse from reaching a negative quantity. If you 
select this combination, a particular warehouse location can reach a negative quantity provided 
that the material is available in another location in the warehouse.
Warehouse selected, Location cleared  – If you select this combination, neither warehouses nor 
locations are allowed to reach a negative quantity.
Auto Issue locations are exempt and are allowed to reach negative quantities regardless of the 
setting.
Allocations are not considered. The system only considers quantity on hand when determining 
whether the location reaches a negative quantity.
8Select the Allocate Negative  check box to allocate demand even though it may cause a negative 
balance.
9Use the Prevent Negative Backdating check box to determine how to examine current inventory 
when a backdated inventory transaction is generated in Inventory Transaction Entry, Shipping 
Entry, Receiving Entry, or IBT Shipping Entry. If you select this check box, then the quantity you 
had on hand on the date of the transaction is used to determine inventory levels. If you did not 
have sufficient quantity on the date of the transaction, then the transaction cannot be completed. 
For example, say you enter an adjust out inventory transaction on January 5 for 10 units, but you 
specify January 3 as the transaction date. If you only had 8 units in your inventory on January 3, 
then you are prevented from completing the backdated transaction if you select the Prevent 
Negative Backdating check box.
If you clear the Prevent Negative Backdating check box, then the quantity you have on hand on 
the date you enter the transaction is used to determine inventory levels. For example, say you 
enter an adjust out inventory transaction on January 5 for 10 units, but you specify January 3 as 
the transaction date. If you have 10 units on hand on January 5, then you can complete the 
transaction, even if you did not have 10 units on hand on January 3. When you clear the Prevent 
Negative Backdating check box, you can generate negative inventory balances for past dates, 
even though you do not allow negative inventory balances for current dates.

Specifying Site Scheduling Information
Use the Scheduling tab to define the default shop calendar for the site. The weekly shop calendar 
defines standard workday and shift information for your plant. The Global Scheduler uses this 
information when producing a shop schedule. You can define calendars specific to a particular 
schedule or individual shop resource. Where neither of these are defined, the calendar specified here 
is used. This calendar should therefore define the default work week. Exceptions for holidays and 
different work center schedules are handled elsewhere.
If you are licensed to use a single site, set up scheduling information in Application Global 
Maintenance.
1Click the Scheduling  tab.
2In the Production Schedule section, click Define Production Schedule and specify this 
information:
ID – Specify an ID for the production schedule.
Description  – Specify a description for the production schedule.
Note: You can also specify a default production schedule ID for the site when you access the 
Global Scheduler. If you have not yet defined the default production schedule ID for a site, when 
you access the Global Scheduler you will be prompted to define the ID and description for each 
site that does not have a default production schedule ID.
3In the table, specify this information:
1st Shift Start  – Enter the starting time for the first shift for each day of the week. By default, the 
first shift starts in the morning (AM).
Shift 1, Shift 2, Shift 3 – For each day that has at least one shift, specify the length in hours of 
each shift. If a shift is not worked, enter a 0.
The totals of the three shifts cannot exceed 24 hours.
Creating a Site
4 – 8 | Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide First Shift is the period of hours starting at the 1st Shift Start time and ending after the specified 
number of hours in the shift. Second shift follows immediately after the first shift and ends after 
the specified number of hours. Third shift is immediately after the second shift; it ends after the 
specified number of hours.
For example, if you specify a shift start of 7:00:00 AM, a first shift length of 8 hours, a second shift 
length of 8 hours, and a third shift length of 4 hours, first shift is 7:00 AM to 3:00 PM, second shift 
is 3:00 PM to 11:00 PM, and third shift begins at 11:00 PM and runs until 3:00 AM.
4Use the check boxes to define scheduling parameters. The selections you make apply to all 
schedules for the site. Select one or more of these options:
Treat All Release Dates as Hard in All Schedules  – To schedule all work orders based on their 
hard release dates, select this check box. If you select this check box, the Concurrent Scheduler 
schedules no activity on any work orders in any schedule before the work order’s hard release 
date, which you specify when you create the work order. If you select this check box, the Treat 
release date as hard check box on individual work orders is not available.
To decide whether to treat the release date as hard on a work order by work order basis, clear this 
check box. When you clear this check box, the Treat release date as hard check box becomes 
available on individual work orders. If you clear the Treat release date as hard check box on an 
individual work order, the release date is disregarded, and the work order is scheduled as time 
and materials allow.
Use All Supply Before Applying Lead-time in Material Checks  – To consider material supply 
beyond work orders’ required dates, select this check box. When you select this check box, the 
scheduler ignores a work order’s required date when locating material supply. When sufficient 
supply is located, the work order is scheduled. If sufficient supply cannot be located, then the 
material’s lead time is used to determine when the work order can be scheduled.
If you select this check box, then all parts in the site will use all supply before applying lead time. 
You cannot override the setting on the part record.
To consider material supply only up to the work order’s required date, clear this check box. When 
you clear this check box, the scheduler does not look beyond the required date for supply when 
there is insufficient supply at the required date. In this case, it applies the part’s or requirement’s 
lead time to determine if sufficient supply can be  obtained by the required date, or to determine 
w
hen it can obtain sufficient supply.
If you clear the check box in Site Maintenance, you can specify on a part-by-part basis which 
setting to use. In Part Maintenance, use the Supply Before Leadtime check box specify whether 
or not to use the work order’s required date when assessing supply. 
The Concurrent Scheduler considers purchase orders, purchase order delivery schedules, 
Coproducts, work orders, and, if netting planned orders, planned orders, as supply.
Use Global Calendar and Exceptions for Fabricated Parts  – To take calendar exceptions into 
account when calculating availability dates for your fabricated parts, select this check box. By 
using this setting you can specify the dates you do not want to use in calculations. Clear the 
check box to ignore calendar exceptions.
Use Global Calendar and Exceptions for Release Dates  – To take calendar exceptions into 
account when calculating release dates, select this check box. By using this setting you can

any packlist can be deleted provided that no invoices have been created for the packlist. Clear the 
check box to allow packlists to be deleted only if the ship date is in an open period.
6In the Partial Shipments with Pre-invoiced Orders section, select one option:
Create memo with excess balance  – Select this option if you would like to create a memo for 
any excess amount from pre-invoices or progress billings when customer orders are partially 
shipped. For example, if the customer has been pre-invoiced for $300 for a certain quantity of a 
part, and you have shipped $200 worth, then the system generates a memo worth $100 for the 
customer's account.
Retain excess balance for future shipments  – Select this option if you would like to retain the 
excess amount that a customer has been pre-invoiced or has been progress billed. The system 
behaves differently depending on if you pre-invoice the customer or progress bill the customer.
If you progress bill the customer, the system considers the amount to apply on a line-by-line 
basis. For example, if the customer has a progress billing invoice for $300 for a certain quantity of 
a part on line 1 of the customer order, and you have shipped $200 worth, then the system retains 
the $100 to apply to a future shipment of the same part on line 1 of the customer order.
If you create the pre-invoice in Accounts Receivable Invoice Entry, then the grand total of the 
customer order is considered when the system determines the amount to refund or apply to a 
future shipment. The individual lines are not considered.
If you close the customer order or a line short prior to consuming all of a pre-invoice amount, the 
user must manually generate a memo to offset the remaining balance of the pre-invoice.
If you select this option, certain options may be disabled in Invoice Forms. If at least one 
customer order has been partially shipped and has a pre-invoice applied to it, the system disables 
the Create A/R Invoices, Combine All Packlists for an Order on One Invoice, and Combine All

Quantity Complete by Hours  – To automatically calculate quantity complete or percentage of 
completion based on the hours reported on the labor ticket, select this check box.
If you report labor based on quantity complete, then this calculation is made to determine the 
quantity completed during the labor ticket:
Creating a Site
Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide | 4 – 15(hours reported on ticket/total estimated hours for operation) * operation quantity
If you report labor based on percentage complete, then this calculation is made to determine the 
percentage:
(hours reported on ticket/estimated hours for operation) * 100
The operation is automatically closed when the quantity or percentage complete equals or 
exceeds the operation quantity. 
If you select the Quantity Complete by Hours check box in Site Maintenance, then all run type 
labor transactions in the site are automatically calculated. 
Max Percent Completed  – If you selected the Quantity Complete by Hours check box, use this 
field to specify the maximum percentage that can be calculated automatically. When the 
percentage complete meets the threshold that you specify, automatic calculation of quantity 
complete is stopped. The operation remains on your schedule until the operation is manually 
closed. This formula is used to calculate the number of hours for the operation that remain on 
your schedule:
((100 - value specified in Max Percent Completed field)/100) * total hours required for the 
operation
If you specify a value in this field, then automatic calculation of labor on all operations in the site 
will stop at the value that you specify.

7In the Auto Issue Method section, click one of these options:
Based on Operation Qty Complete  – Click this option to auto-issue material requirements 
incrementally based on the quantity or percent completed on each labor ticket. For example, 
presume that the operation is for a quantity of 5 and the Qty Per for the material requirement is 1. 
If a quantity of 2 is completed on a labor ticket, then 2 units of the material requirement are issued 
(presuming that there is no fixed scrap or deviated quantity). If an operation is closed before all 
quantities are completed, then the material requirement is also closed short. 
Based on the Full Requirement Qty on First Labor Ticket – Click this option to auto-issue the 
full material requirement quantity after the first labor ticket is reported for the operation. If you 
backflush labor without creating labor tickets, then the full material requirement is issued after the 
first quantity is backflushed. 
Depending on how you set up Preferences Maintenance, the issued quantity can include fixed 
scrap and extra materials for deviated quantities that are reported on the first labor ticket.
If a labor ticket has already been created for the operation or a quantity has already been 
backflushed, then additional material is not issued. For example, if you created a labor ticket for 
an operation and then increased the quantity of the material requirement, the additional 
requirement will not be issued. 
Note: If operations are in process when you select this auto-issue method, additional materials 
are not issued to any in-process operation. To complete material issues for in-process operations, 
you must manually issue the materials. 
Based on Full Remaining Req Qty on Run Complete  – When you use this option, materials are 
issued in proportion to the quantity or percent complete on the operation until the Run Complete 
labor ticket is saved to the operation. When the Run Complete labor ticket is saved, all remaining 
material requirements are issued to the operation, even if the operation is closed short. If you 
backflush labor during the shipment of customer orders, then the full remaining quantity of a 
material requirement is issued when the full quantity of the order line has been shipped or when 
the line is closed short. 
Depending on how you set up Preferences Maintenance, this quantity can include fixed scrap and 
extra materials for deviated quantities.

What is Costing?
5 – 2 | Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide What is Costing?
To determine an organization’s profits and losses, the costs associated with the production of the end 
product must be accumulated, measured, and recorded. 
To set up costing, you must determine how to calculate costs and which accounts to use to record the 
costs. Use the Costing tab in Accounting Entity Maintenance to determine how to calculate the costs 
you record. Use the Application Global Maintenance (Financials) window to assign default accounts 
to record the costs. In many cases, you can override the default account on an individual record.
After you set up how to measure costs and where to record them, costs are tracked when you 
perform transactions, such as inventory issues to work orders, purchases of inventory, and shipments 
of customer orders. To post these costs to your general ledger, run the Costing Utilities to calculate 
the current costs, then use the Post Manufacturing Journals window to post the transactions to your 
general ledger.
You can analyze costs before or after you post them in the Costing Tools window. Costing Tools 
show when an expected cost does not match to the cost actually applied. 
This chapter describes:
• How to set up costing, including selecting a costing method
• How to assign accounts to use for costing
• How to analyze costs
Types of Manufacturing Costs
Four types of costs are typically incurred during manufacturing. These costs are:
Material  – Material cost is the cost of the raw materials that comprise your product.
Labor  – Labor is the cost incurred by employees. Labor costs can be direct or indirect. Direct labor 
costs are incurred when raw materials are assembled into finished goods. Indirect labor costs are 
overhead costs that cannot be directly charged to the manufacture of a product. Indirect labor 
includes costs such as vacation time and administrative time.
Burden  – Burden costs are overhead expenses, such as rent, utilities, and depreciation. Burden 
costs can be associated with the purchase and issue of material and with the operation of shop 
resources.
Service  – Service costs are incurred when an outside agency performs an operation to a part.
The costing method and costing settings you select determine how these costs are calculated.
Setting Up Costing
Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide | 5 – 3Setting Up Costing
To access the Costing tab, select Admin , Accounting Entity Maintenance . Click the Costing  tab.
About Costing Methods
You can select one of these costing methods:
Standard Costing  – Standard Costing values every inventory transaction at the cost standards 
you set in Part Maintenance at the time of the transaction. Differences between the part standard 
value and the actual cost are recorded in variance accounts in the general ledger.
Actual Costing  – Actual Costing uses the source of the raw material cost to define the value of all 
inventory in the system. It uses the hourly labor rate of the employee that creates the labor ticket 
and the invoice value of any services received. Actual costing uses your First-In-First-Out (FIFO) 
rules to assign value when the inventory is consumed. 
If you are licensed to use Projects/A&D functionality, you must select Actual as your costing 
method in all entities. If a particular entity does not engage in project work, that entity must still 
use the Actual costing method if you have applied a projects/A&D license. 
Average Costing  – Average costing also uses the source of the raw material cost, but calculates 
costs based on the average material cost in your inventory. Average Costing calculates the 
current running average of inventory for each part and assigns that value when inventory is 
consumed.
The options on the Costing tab become available or unavailable based on the costing method you 
choose. 
In addition to specifying a costing method for finished goods, you also specify a costing method for 
work in process (WIP). 
Considerations Before Choosing a Costing Method
Certain functionality is only available if you use a particular costing method. If you intend to use the 
functions described in this section, select a costing method that is compatible with the functions.Caution:  The costing options that you select, especially costing method, drastically affect 
how the costing portion of VISUAL operates. Before deciding on any of these 
options, be sure to read the Costing chapter of the System-wide guide. Do not 
make a permanent selection without fully understanding the implications; if you are 
unsure, contact your sales associate, or Customer Support. After you begin 
executing transactions, you CANNOT change these options.
Setting Up Costing
5 – 4 | Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide Projects/A&D
If you have applied a Projects/A&D license to your database, you must use the Actual costing method 
and the By Part Location FIFO Method / Inventory Grouping setting. 
Landed costs
If you intend to use landed costs, you must use either the Average or Actual costing method. You 
cannot use the Standard costing method. When you enable landed costs, you can link multiple 
Accounts Payable Invoices to a single purchase receipt line.
You can activate the landed costs feature in Financials Application Global Maintenance.
Consignment
If you use Actual or Average Costing methods and you store consigned items from your customers or 
vendors, you must use By Part Location as your FIFO Method / Inventory Grouping. If you use Actual 
or Average Costing methods with FIFO By Part, then the From Vendor and From Vendor location 
types are removed from Warehouse Maintenance, and Consignment Receiving cannot be used.
If you use Actual or Average Costing methods and only use consignment to store your inventory at 
vendors or customers, you can use either FIFO by Part or FIFO by Part Location.
You can use Standard Costing methods for your consigned inventory without restriction. 
See the “Consignment” chapter in the Inventory user’s guide.
Setting Up Standard Costing
Standard costing is the method of comparing predetermined estimates of cost to the actual 
expenditures for building/purchasing a product. Any difference between the standard and actual is a 
variance . With standard costing, every part, component, operation, and assembly has a standard 
cost. Typically, you would derive standard costs annually, usually in conjunction with the annual 
physical inventory.
To set up standard costing, specify the Standard option in Accounting Entity Maintenance and 
determine other costing settings. Use Part Maintenance, Shop Resource Maintenance, Outside 
Service Maintenance, and Employee Maintenance to set up cost standards.
Specifying Standard Costing Options
This procedure describes how to set up options specific to Standard costing method. Refer to Setting 
Up a WIP Costing Method and Selecting a Receipt Exchange Rate Date to complete costing set up.
Setting Up Costing
Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide | 5 – 51Select Admin , Accounting Entity Maintenance .
2In the Costing Method section, select the Standard  option.
3In the Labor Cost Basis section, select one of these options:
Hours Worked  – Select this option to calculate labor costs by multiplying the hours reported on a 
labor ticket by the standard cost of the operation.
Quantity Produced  – Select this option to calculate labor costs by multiplying the quantity 
completed for an operation by the standard cost per unit for the operation.
4In the Costing Between Levels section, specify how to process costs when one fabricated part is 
a material requirement in another fabricated part. 
When you fabricate a part, costs are incurred in all four cost categories: material, labor, burden, 
and service. When you use a fabricated part as a material requirement, you can combine the four 
cost categories and use the total as the material cost of the requirement, or you can keep each 
cost category separate.
Choose one of these options:
Fold to Material Cost  – If you select this option, the Material, Labor, Burden, and Service cost of 
an internally fabricated part are summed into the material cost when it is required in another 
fabricated part. The entire cost of the requirement is counted as material cost.
Keep Separate Costs – If you select this option, the Material, Labor, Burden, and Service costs 
of an internally manufactured material requirement contribute to those individual categories in 
parent assemblies. 
For example: where Fabricated Part B requires Fabricated Part A.

5 – 6 | Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide Specifying Standards
Use Part Maintenance, Shop Resource Maintenance, and Outside Service Maintenance to set up 
standard costs. 
Specifying Part Standard Costs
Use Part Maintenance to specify the standard costs for manufactured and purchased parts. You can 
also define which G/L accounts to use to record the costs.
For fabricated parts, you can specify material, labor, burden, and service standard costs. For raw 
materials (parts that are not fabricated), you specify materials costs. For a purchased part, you can 
also specify a fixed cost. 
The cost standards are used in these transactions:
• Material adjust-in transactions use these values to determine the transaction costs. The quantity
adjusted-in is multiplied by the standard costs to determine the FIFO layer’s value.
• Engineering masters use the standard costs for their estimates. Based on the Engineering
masters, costs will flow next to the work order estimate cost when they are created.
• Purchase order receipts use the standard costs when goods are received. The total received
amount is compared to the accounts payable voucher costs to determine purchase price
variances.
• Finished Goods receipts use standard costs for receipts. The costs received are compared to the
incurred WIP amounts to determine Finished Goods Variances.
You can also specify burden amounts or rates that apply to purchases and material issues. Burden is 
the capitalization of current overhead manufacturing costs to the parts that are manufactured during 
that period. Purchase burden is applied when materials are purchased and received into inventory. 
Issue burden is applied when materials are issued to a job. Issue burden is carried in the part’s 
inventory value until it is shipped. Inventory value moves to Costs of Goods Sold upon shipment.
If you are licensed to use multiple sites, specify costing information at the site level. 
To specify standard costs for parts:

Calculating Fabricated Part Cost Standards from Engineering Masters
Use the Implode Costs function to calculate cost standards for your fabricated parts based on the raw 
materials, resources, and services on the fabricated part’s engineering master.
You can use this function at the site level only.
If your fabricated part is made up of purchased parts, these calculations are made to determine the 
costs for the fabricated part:
Material  – The material costs of all material requirements, plus the fixed costs for the material 
requirements, are added and inserted in the Material field for the parent part. 
Labor  – The labor costs for any shop resources used in operations are added and inserted in the 
Labor field for the parent part.
Burden  – The burden costs for shop resources in operations plus the burden costs for material 
requirements are added and inserted in the Burden field for the parent part.
Setting Up Costing
5 – 8 | Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide Services  – The service costs from operations are combined and inserted into the Services field.
Fabricated parts can be made up of other fabricated parts. If your parent part uses fabricated parts for 
material requirements, costs are determined based on your selection in the Costing Between Levels 
section on the Costing tab in Accounting Entity Maintenance. If you selected Fold to Material Costs, 
all cost categories for fabricated material requirements are combined and used as the material cost 
for the requirements. If you selected Keep Separate Costs, the Material, Labor, Burden, and Service

Setting Up Costing
5 – 10 | Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide Setting up Actual Costing
Note: If you have applied a Projects/A&D license to your database, use the Actual costing method.
Use the Costing tab in Accounting Entity Maintenance to set up actual costing. Actual costing uses 
these costs:
Labor  – The pay rates set up for employees in Employee Maintenance are used for labor costs in 
transactions. If the employee is paid hourly, the hourly rate is used. If the employee is a salaried 
employee, the value used in a transaction is the prorated share of the employee’s salary. You can 
override labor rates in Labor Ticket Entry. You can also calculate overtime in Labor Ticket Entry.
Material  – Material costs depend upon the source of raw material costs and the FIFO method you 
choose. You can choose either Purchase Orders or A/P Invoices as the source of the material cost. 
You can choose either by part or by part location as your FIFO method. If you choose by part, then 
the location where the part was received is ignored. When you issue a part, the cost used is the price 
of the oldest part in your inventory regardless of location. If you choose by part location as your FIFO 
method, then location is considered when determining the cost of a part. When you choose by part 
location the cost of the oldest part in the location from which you are issuing the part is used as the 
material cost.
Burden  – Burden costs depend upon the selection you make in the Burden Basis section. If you 
select Determined by Resource Burden, then the burden information specified in the Burden Costs 
section in Shop Resource Maintenance is used. If you select Determined by Operation Burden, then 
the burden information specified on the operation card for the work order is used. 
Services  – Services costs depend upon the source of raw material costs you choose. If you choose 
Purchase Orders, then the costs of services match the costs on the purchase order. If you choose A/
P Invoices, then the costs of services match the costs on the A/P Invoice.
This procedure describes how to set up options specific to Actual costing method. Refer to Setting Up 
a WIP Costing Method and Selecting a Receipt Exchange Rate Date to complete costing set up.
To set up actual costing:
1In the Costing Method section, click the Actual  option.
2In the FIFO Method/Inventory Grouping section, select how to determine first in-first out costs. 
Click one of these options: 
By Part  – Click this option to calculate costs based on the order in which you received the part  
regardless of the location. If you are licensed to use multiple sites, the locations must be within 
the same site.
For example, you receive the same parts, four times, at four prices, into these locations:
You then issue 15 of those parts from location 1. If you select By Part , costs are calculated as:
10@$1 plus 5@$2 totaling $20Day 1 Location 1 10@$1
Day 2 Location 2 10@$2
Day 3 Location 1 10@$3
Day 4 Location 2 10@$4
Setting Up Costing
Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide | 5 – 11Because you received the part at $1 first then $2, these prices are used for By Part  calculations.
By Part Location  – Costs are calculated based on the order in which you received the part into 
the location.
For example, you receive the same parts, four times, at four prices, into these locations:
You then issue 15 of those parts from location 1. If you select By Part Location , costs are 
calculated as:
10@$1 plus 5@$3 totaling $25
Because FIFO is by part location, only those parts in location 1 are used.
If you are licensed to use VISUAL DCMS and part trace, you can use trace IDs in your FIFO 
calculations. Select the Actual Costing by Trace ID check box to issue parts based on trace ID. 
For example, presume you received four Part X at $10 on trace ID 100, then receive four more at 
$20 on trace ID 110. If you issued three based on trace ID 110, the parts would be valued at $20 
each.
If you are licensed to use Projects/A&D, you must use By Part Location as your FIFO method. 
3In the Source of Raw Material Cost section, specify the transaction to use as the source of costs 
for purchased materials. Click one of these options:
Purchase Orders  – Select this option to use the price specified on the purchase order as the 
source of raw material cost. The cost is taken from the purchase order when you receive the part 
into your inventory. This option is only preferable if you are not using VISUAL Financials.
A/P Invoices  – Select this option to use the price paid on the A/P invoice as the final cost for the 
part. When you select this option, costs are first taken from the purchase order as an estimate, 
then updated from the invoice for the purchase. This option provides a more accurate 
assessment of costs. If you use VISUAL Financials, you should select this option.
4In the Costing Between Levels section, specify how to process costs when one fabricated part is 
a material requirement in another fabricated part. 
When you fabricate a part, costs are incurred in all four cost categories: material, labor, burden, 
and service. When you use a fabricated part as a material requirement, you can combine the four 
cost categories and use the total as the material cost of the requirement, or you can keep each 
cost category separate.
Choose one of these options:
Fold to Material Cost  – If you select this option, the Material, Labor, Burden, and Service cost of 
an internally fabricated part are summed into the material cost when it is required in another 
fabricated part. The entire cost of the requirement is counted as material cost.Day 1 Location 1 10@$1

Setting Up Costing
Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide | 5 – 13Material  – The total cost of all parts in your inventory is divided by the total number of parts to 
determine the average cost. 
The source of raw material cost you choose determines the values used to calculate the total cost of 
the parts in your inventory. You can choose either Purchase Orders or A/P Invoices as the source of 
the material cost. The FIFO method you choose determines how the total value of parts in your 
inventory is recalculated when you issue parts. 
For example, presume you received parts at these values into these locations:
The total value of the part in your inventory is $30, and the total number of parts in your inventory is 
12. If you issued one part from Location 1 to a work order, the cost of the part would be valued at 
$2.50 ($30 divided by 12). The second part would be valued at $2.63 ($30 minus the actual value of 
the part equals $29, divided by 11). The third part would be valued at $2.80 ($28 divided by 10). The 
fourth part would be valued at $3.00 ($27 divided by 9). 
The value of the fifth part depends upon your FIFO setting. If you select By Part Location, then 
Location 1 would be used as the source of the material cost, and $3 would be subtracted from the 
total value of your inventory for a result of $27. The result would be divided by 8 for a value of $3.00. If 
you select By Part, then Location 2 would be used as the source of the material cost, and $2 would be 
subtracted from the total value of your inventory. The value of the part would be $3.125 ($28 divided 
by 8).
Burden  – Burden costs depend upon the selection you make in the Burden Basis section. If you 
select Determined by Resource Burden, then the burden information specified in the Burden Costs 
section in Shop Resource Maintenance is used. If you select Determined by Operation Burden, then 
the burden information specified on the operation card for the work order is used. 
Services  – Services costs depend upon the source of raw material costs you choose. If you choose 
Purchase Orders, then the costs of services match the costs on the purchase order. If you choose A/
P Invoices, then the costs of services match the costs on the A/P Invoice.

Selecting a WIP Costing Method
To specify the WIP costing method, select one of these options:
Actual  – Actual WIP values any receipts from Work In Process at the full value of the Work Order.
For example, you are making 100 parts and each part requires $1.00 of material. On the first day you 
issue $100 of material to the Work Order. If you finish 1 part on the first day it will be valued at $100 – 
the full value of the Work Order. On the second day, when you receive the other 99 parts, the costing 
utility will re-value the receipt from previous day to $1 and share the other $99 with the other receipts. 
The value of an Actual WIP costed Work Order without any receipts is always zero.
Projected  – Projected WIP values any receipts at the estimated unit cost based on the quantity 
received and the remaining quantity to complete. For example, you are making 100 parts and each 
part requires $1.00 of material. On the first day, you issue $100 of material to the Work Order. If you 
finish one part on the first day, the work order would produce a cost of $1 for 1 part on the first day 
and then $1 each for the remaining 99 parts the next day. Projected WIP receipt values will never 
exceed the actual cost in the job.

Use Invoice Date  – Select this option to apply the exchange rate as of the date of the invoice. The 
invoice date is either the date specified on the transaction or the current date, depending on your 
setting in the Effective Exchange Rate date section on the General tab.
Specifying a POC Revenue Recognition Method
If you are licensed to use Aerospace & Defense modules, select a Percentage of Completion (POC) 
revenue recognition method. The primary difference between the two revenue recognition methods is 
how direct cost and burden amounts are calculated. With the Revenue First method, costs are 
calculated by applying the POC to a pro-rated share of each cost source. With the Cost to Cost 
method, the actual costs incurred are included in the revenue calculation.
To choose a POC revenue recognition method, click one of these options:
Revenue First  – When you click this option, total revenue to be recognized is calculated first by 
multiplying the total price of the contract by the percentage of completion. Then, the total costs 
incurred are calculated by multiplying the total costs in the EAC by the percentage of the total cost 
each cost area represents. Then, the product is multiplied by the percentage of completion. 
For example, presume your project has these costs and fees in the Estimate at Completion (EAC):
If the POC value at the end of the first period is 25%, then these calculations are made:
$10,000 * 0.25 = $2,500. The total revenue recognized for the period is $2,500. The $2,500 includes 
these costs:
Labor = $8,000 * 0.3125 * 0.25 = $625
Material = $8,000 * 0.5 * 0.25 = $1,000
Services/ODC = $8,000 * 0.0625 * 0.25 = $125
Burden = $8,000 * 0.125 * 0.25 = $250

Setting Up Costing
5 – 16 | Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide To calculate the total fee recognized, the total costs recognized are subtracted from the total revenue 
recognized:
$2,500 - $2,000 = $500
In subsequent periods, the same calculations are made, then any previously recognized revenue is 
subtracted. For example, if the POC value at the end of the second period is 35%, these calculations 
are made:
$10,000 * 0.35 = $3,500. The total revenue recognized is $3,500 minus the $2,500 already 
recognized, or $1,000. The $1,000 includes these costs:
Labor = $8,000 * 0.3125 * 0.35 = $875. $875 - $625 previously recognized = $250 recognized in 
second period.
Material = $8,000 * 0.5 * 0.35 = $1,400. $1,400 - $1,000 previously recognized = $400 recognized in 
second period.
Services/ODC = $8,000 * 0.0625 * 0.35 = $175. $175 - $125 previously recognized = $50 recognized 
in second period.
Burden = $8,000 * 0.125 * 0.35 = $350 minus $250 previously recognized = $100 recognized in 
second period. 
Total costs to be recognized in second period = $800.
To calculate the total fee recognized, the total costs recognized for the period is subtracted from the 
total revenue recognized for the period:
$1,000 - $800 = $200

Costs and Accounts
5 – 18 | Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide Costs and Accounts
When you post a transaction, costs are recorded in various accounts in your general ledger. You set 
up default accounts in Application Global Maintenance (Financials). 
For some types of costs, you can specify override accounts to use instead of the default accounts. 
You can specify override accounts in these areas:
• Shop Resource Maintenance
• Part Maintenance
• Customer Order Entry
• Purchase Order Entry
• Customer Maintenance
• Vendor Maintenance
You can use override accounts to provide more granularity to your manufacturing costs. For example, 
if you used a different burden override account for each of your shop resources, you could track 
exactly how much each shop resource contributed to your burden costs.
Shop Resource Maintenance
Shop Resource Maintenance allows you to track and maintain the resources necessary to perform 
the manufacturing process as well as providing the necessary method to maintain accurate 
definitions of your shop resources. This information is vital for proper scheduling and work order 
costing. The information entered here will appear and be used in many other parts of the system.
This section discusses how to setup Shop Resources to report more specifically in the General 
Ledger.
In most cases, Labor and Burden are reported to the default Applied Labor and Applied Factory 
Burden accounts from the General Ledger Interface Accounts table.
In some cases, it may be best to show specific Applied Burden and Applied Labor in the General 
Ledger. To do this, you can assign an account to each of the shop resources, or to those for which 
you want to maintain detailed cost information in the General Ledger.
If the Account ID fields are left blank, the cost of this shop resource is added in with the default 
account for Total Applied Labor and Total Applied Burden as specified in the General Ledger 
Interface Accounts table.
Costs are entered into the fields that apply for that resource. These are the types of costs that can be 
selected for the resource:
Labor Costs
Setup per hour  – Cost per hour to setup this resource.
Run per hour  – Cost to run the resource for one hour.
Costs and Accounts
Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide | 5 – 19Run per unit  – Cost to run the resource per unit produced.
Burden Costs
Burden / hour (setup)  – This is the burden cost per one hour of setup time. Use the Percent field and 
/or the dollar amount setup burden for the resource.
Burden / hour (run)  – This is the burden cost per run of the resource. Use the Percent field and / or 
the dollar amount setup burden for this resource.
Burden / unit (run)  – This is the burden cost per unit produced.
Fixed Burden  – A onetime cost (burden) charged when this resource is used.
Part Maintenance
In Part Maintenance, you can override the default accounts in several ways.
In a Part record, you can override the default material, labor, burden, and service accounts by clicking 
the Accounting tab and specifying the overrides. For fabricated parts, you can override all four cost 
accounts. For purchased parts, you can override the material and burden accounts. Any overrides 
specified on the Accounting tab for a part take precedence over any override accounts specified 
elsewhere. If you do not set up override accounts, the default Inventory accounts are used instead.
You can also set up override accounts by product codes. You can override these accounts:
• Inventory (material)
• Inventory (labor)
• Inventory (burden)
• Inventory (service)
• Work in process (material)
• Work in process (labor)
• Work in process (burden)
• Work in process (service)

Inventory Adjustments
Material adjust-in transactions use the cost standards in Part Maintenance to determine the

Product Code G/L Interface Account Table Overrides
Accounts by Product Code
The accounts used by the Costing Utility program can be a function of the Product Code Table from 
Part Maintenance. Here you can specify the accounts to be used by a part’s product code unless an 
override account was specified elsewhere. If no product code is specified in the part, then the 
appropriate override account is used.
You can specify these types of accounts:
Revenue Account  – The default account for use when shipments are invoiced. You can override this 
account at the Customer Order Line. The default account is from the General Ledger Interface 
Accounts Table. (Default Accounts Receivable Sales Revenue).
Adjustment  – The default to be used when making inventory adjustments. You can override this 
account when entering inventory adjustments in Inventory Transaction Entry. If not specified here, the 
adjustment account from the General Ledger Interface table is used.
Inventory  – The Raw Material or Finished Goods account(s) for use when receiving, issuing, 
returning, or adjusting inventory for a specified product code. If not specified here, the account 
numbers specified in the Part Master and then the default from the General Ledger Interface 
Accounts table are used.
Work In Process  – The default Work In Process account(s) for this product code. You can override 
this account at the Quote / Engineering Master / Work Order level(s). If not specified here or in the 
work order, the default account in the General Ledger Interface Accounts table is used.
Variance  – The Purchase Price Variance Account for purchased parts or the Manufacturing Variance 
Account for fabricated parts. These accounts are only used in standard costing. The variance account 
is used for purchased parts in an actual cost system if costs are captured at Purchase Order price 
rather than invoice value. This variance is taken when the Accounts Payable invoice is matched to the 
Purchase Order Receiver in Accounts Payable Invoice Entry.
Cost of Goods Sold  – The Cost of Goods Sold account used for the specified product code. You can 
override this account(s) at the Customer Order line item in Customer Order Entry. If not specified here 
or in Order Entry, the default COGS account(s) in the General Ledger Interface Accounts table are 
used.

5 – 22 | Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide • Scrap
• Substitution
Material variances can be caused by purchase price changes and the amount of material used. 
Purchase price variances  (PPV) occur when the actual cost of the raw material is different from the 
established standard. If the actual cost is lower or higher than the established standard, this 
generates a favorable or unfavorable variance respectively. You should perform an analysis to 
determine if this is a one time occurrence, a result of a change in vendor pricing, or a change in 
purchasing procedures.
Material usage variances occur when more or less than the required material is used in the 
manufacturing process. Material usage variance can occur in manufacturing environments where 
materials have to be issued in bulk due to the way it is purchased and stocked. The standard may be 
based on the average number of units that can be produced from a given unit of stock issued to the 
floor.
Usage variance can also be caused by miscellaneous materials such as small hardware, wire, paint, 
etc. that are not included in the Bill of Material but are required to complete the product. This material 
may be inventoried when purchased and charged to a variance (expense) account as consumed.
Other causes of material usage variance are scrap and substitution. Scrap variances occur when 
defective parts are produced. Scrap, as a result of the manufacturing process, may already be built 
into the standard. Scrap due to error also creates a variance.
A material variance due to substitution can occur when it is necessary to use a material other than 
what is called for in the Bill of Material. This material may cost more or less, yield a different quantity, 
etc. This variance may be caused by a one time occurrence due to a unique situation or as the result 
of a change in the design of a product. This change can be the result of a cost improvement program 
or a change in vendors.
Labor Variance
In a standard cost system, labor variance is the difference between the direct labor standard 
established and the actual amount paid. This variance can be composed of two pieces: 
• Efficiency
• Rate
Labor efficiency variance  is the difference between the standard hours required per the Bill of 
Material and the actual hours expended to produce the part, extended by the standard labor rate.
For example, if the standard is 10 hours at $15 per hour and the actual is 8 hours, there is a favorable 
efficiency variance of $30.
Labor rate variance  is the difference between the standard hourly rate and the actual rate paid, 
extended by the actual hours worked.
Continuing with the above example, if the actual rate is $18 per hour, the rate variance is an 
unfavorable $24. The combined labor variance is a favorable $6.
The above variances can also be affected by:
• Rework
Costs and Accounts
Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide | 5 – 23• Unapplied labor
• Design changes
Rework  occurs when a defective part is produced during the manufacturing process, but can be 
made usable with some additional processing. The added time required is not part of the standard 
and is included in the variance.
Unapplied labor  occurs when it is not economical to apply a standard to some labor operations. 
Examples may include set up, painting or plating, and inspection.
Design changes  can occur due to operations being added that were overlooked, or operations being 
deleted due to cost improvement programs.
Burden (Overhead) Absorption
Overhead  – Burden, overhead, or indirect manufacturing expense are any expenses that cannot be 
classified as direct material or direct labor. These include:
• Indirect labor payroll associated with the shop foreman, maintenance personnel, dispatchers
• Expense for rent, utilities, depreciation
• Non-inventory supplies
• Tools, and travel
These expenses are then allocated to the cost of the products.
A burden standard is established based on how the expense is capitalized to inventory. For every unit 
produced, a standard dollar amount (either fixed or calculated) is added to the inventory value of the 
unit.
Absorption  – A burden absorption variance occurs when more or less expense than was actually 
incurred is capitalized to inventory in a given accounting period.
For example, assume the actual burden expenses incurred in a period are $65,000 and the 
manufacturing process absorbs $67,000 based on the allocation method used. The difference would 
be a $2,000 favorable absorption variance.
Manufacturing Cost
Whether using standard or actual costing, all transactions that change a part’s inventory balance or 
the unit cost are captured as they occur.
In order to fully appreciate Costing, it is necessary to understand inventory valuation.
Inventory Valuation  – There are a number of different methods to value inventory LIFO, FIFO and 
Average Cost. VISUAL uses the FIFO (First-in First-out) method of valuing inventory. The FIFO 
method of inventory valuation assigns cost to inventory in cost layers. Each addition (purchase, 
inventory receipt, or adjustment in) adds a new cost layer. Each subtraction (issue, sale, or 
adjustment out) removes one or more cost layers.
VISUAL uses two types of FIFO layers:
Costs and Accounts
5 – 24 | Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide • Raw materials inventory contains layers by way of purchases from a supplier or when you create
a return from an issue return from work-in-process back to inventory (in the case of an over
issue).
• Work-in-process can also contain FIFO layers, which include multiple inventory issues for the
same part on a work order. This is categorized as a WIP Issue Layer.
The examples in Table A, on page 47, depict transaction flows in an actual cost database. In a 
standard cost database all inventory transactions are performed at the standard rate and therefore 
the melded issue costs carry the same value as the FIFO inventory layers.
FIFO From Purchases  – Every receipt of raw material inventory or finished goods inventory (no 
distinction is made) is assigned a per unit price value. Raw material inventory FIFO layers are created 
when a purchase is received into inventory. The cost of the purchased inventory is derived by the 
number of units received times the per unit cost as identified on the purchase order. This value will 
also represent the purchase order accrual value. Each purchase creates a unique layer of inventory 
which displays the inventory valuation report accessed from the Reports menu.
FIFO Layers from Issue Returns  – Issue returns (parts issued to a work order returned to inventory) 
also create a FIFO layer. When parts are issued to a work order their costs are added to work-in-
process based on the raw material FIFO layer they came from. If the issue to WIP is derived from 
more than one layer then the costs of all the layers issued to fulfill the requirement are melded 
together to create a single WIP issue layer. Any subsequent issues of the same part to a work order 
will create an additional WIP issue layer. If a part on the work order is returned to inventory from work-
in-process, a new cost layer is created with the layers value being derived from the WIP issue layers 
currently residing in the work order. If there is only one issue of a particular part for the work order the 
cost is straight forward. It would be the average unit cost (by melding original FIFO layers) times the 
number of units returned to inventory. 
Where there are more than one raw material inventory “issues” to a work order the costs are returned 
from the WIP issue layers in FIFO order. 
FIFO Layers from Receipts and/or Adjust In  – Two other ways FIFO layers in inventory happen are 
through a receipt of inventory (finished goods) from a work order. The cost of the inventory layer is 
derived from the average unit cost on the work order times the number of units. If the receipt closes 
the work order (complete receipts) the entire cost of the work order at the time of the receipt is the 
value of the FIFO layer.
Adjustments into inventory create a separate cost layer in inventory for the per unit cost assigned 
during inventory transaction entry. If no cost is assigned at that time, the cost will be derived by the 
unit cost as set on the part master file when costing utilities is run.
Inventory Transactions
There are 10 classes of inventory transactions. Each of these transactions either move goods in or 
out of inventory, or transfer between inventory locations. There are, therefore, 18 possible transaction 
types. Most transactions affecting inventory (with the exception of transfers) either add or remove 
costs from inventory.
Costs and Accounts
Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide | 5 – 25Transaction Types (Basics)
P/O Receipts  – The P/O Receipts are purchased items received into stock. When these costs are 
received they are assigned to an inventory warehouse location. The number of units purchased as 
well as the cost of the purchased part(s) will become a new cost layer of raw materials inventory. 
When the PO Receipt is received into inventory the entry is booked to record a purchase accrual 
(credit) with the offsetting debit to Inventory.
Inventory parts can be purchased directly to a work order. When these parts are received they are 
booked to raw materials inventory and immediately issued to the corresponding work order. The 
inventory transaction entry report will depict this process. Purchased parts that are purchased on 
behalf of an existing work order are given the same treatment as inventory issues when received into 
the warehouse. The only time these costs would become a FIFO layer is if they are subsequently 
received into inventory through an inventory issue return.
As stated above VISUAL uses the FIFO method of valuing inventory. However, there is another level 
of complexity to inventory valuation; part warehouse location. For each part in inventory, there may 
be multiple holding bins in the warehouse. Each inventory transaction affects one or more of these 
locations, and VISUAL must therefore maintain each of these locations in order to report proper 
inventory valuations if the FIFO by part locations in Accounting Entity Maintenance is set.
Services  – In the same manner as purchased parts, services can be purchased directly from the 
manufacturing window and are treated by costing utilities as if they were purchased parts. Costs are 
booked to WIP with the offset to the purchase accrual account.
Inventory Issues/Issue Returns  – Inventory issues are transactions that assign raw material 
inventory to a specific work order. Inventory issues will normally cause the reduction of one or more 
inventory layer(s). These costs become the basis of the material costs assigned to WIP. Inventory 
issue transactions are prepared by costing utilities to debit WIP and credit Inventory.
Issue returns are inventory parts sent back to the warehouse. Issue returns would most likely result 
from overissues or raw materials to a work order. Costing utilities accounts for these costs by a credit 
to raw materials inventory and a debit to WIP.
To improve the performance of costing utilities, an issue return with a monetary value of zero is 
evaluated only once during costing. After the first evaluation, these zero-value transactions are 
ignored by the costing utilities.
Accounts Payable  – Costs can be directly assigned through accounts payable for items that did not 
undergo the normal purchasing process. In the invoice entry window these costs can be linked to the 
work order. In doing so, VISUAL requires the user to enter the GL code to cost the items. The GL 
Account assigned to an accounts payable invoice linked directly to a work order is treated as a 
clearing account. Costing utilities post and offset entry to the GL account and apply the transaction 
value to WIP.
Warehouse Transferred  – The cost implication (i.e., treatment of warehouse transfers) is dependent 
on the setting for FIFO method in application global. If you select FIFO by Part, transfers from one 
location to another do not have any cost implications; inventory transaction entry simply records the 
movement (without cost implication) to the new location. If you select FIFO by part location in 
Accounting Entity Maintenance, cost movements between locations are recorded.
Adjustments In/Out (Inventory)  – Usually, inventory adjustments stem from physical inventory 
counts. Typically, companies take physical counts to keep perpetual records in line with actual 
inventory on hand. Discrepancies between the actual inventory on hand and the perpetual records 
Costs and Accounts
5 – 26 | Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide require inward or outward adjustments. If an inward adjustment is required, VISUAL costs this 
adjustment as a new cost layer. Outward adjustments remove costs from an existing cost layer or 
potentially remove an entire cost layer from inventory. When entering adjustments through inventory 
transaction entry, you are required to assign a G/L account for the other side of the transaction. Raw 
materials inventory is either debited or credited depending on the adjustment type. You must define 
the G/L offset account to apply the other side of the transaction.
Direct Labor / Burden  – Labor charges are applied during labor ticket entry. Whether entering labor 
charges through bar code or entering via a computer terminal station, costs are applied to the labor 
ticket area. All costs for setup and run times are recorded into WIP via costing utilities. In order to 
record direct labor in WIP, a debit is created to WIP labor, and a credit to Manufacturing Direct 
payroll.
Burden (overhead) represents costs associated with the cost of manufacturing without the ability to 
identify these cost to specific operations or jobs in WIP at any one point in time. For example, rent, 
lighting, general plant maintenance, and depreciation are costs that every manufacturing environment 
incurs but are not attributable to specific jobs in WIP.
Costing provides for the ability to set burden rates to attempt to capture these costs and allocate them 
to jobs that flow through WIP. You can apply burden to raw materials inventory as well as to specific 
operations used in the manufacturing process. Burden rates applied to raw materials inventory on the 
part master file will cause burden to be charged each time the part is issued to a work order. Burden 
costs assigned operations are applied to WIP at the time of Labor ticket entry.
The burden costs applied during labor ticket entry come from the settings assigned on the resource in 
shop resource maintenance. The burden rate is derived either from the operation set in shop 
resource maintenance, on the operation in the bill of materials. The determination of whether cost are 
extended from the resource or the work order depends on the Burden Basis setting as defined on 
the Cost  tab in application global. If you select Determined by Resource Burden , the settings are 
examined in Resource Maintenance to determine the appropriate amount of burden to apply. If you 
select Determined by Operation Burden  in application global, then the amounts applied on the work 
order are used to determine the amount of burden.
Indirect Labor  – Indirect labor is applied in the same manner as direct labor; the only difference is the 
transaction type in the Labor Ticket Entry window must be set to Indirect rather than Setup  or Run. 
Indirect labor is not charged to specific jobs. Costs associated with indirect labor are reclassed from 
manufacturing payroll to the appropriate manufacturing indirect labor G/L account(s).
Shipments (Sales)  – Shipments of customer orders cause specific transactions to take place within 
the system. Costs accumulated in work in process are marked as Closed . Inventory costs (WIP) then 
flow through to cost of sales in the general ledger in two distinct entries. The first entry reclassifies 
work in process costs to finished goods inventory. The second entry records the transfer of finished 
goods inventory to Cost of sales to properly match costs with revenue as required by generally 
accepted accounting principles.
Standard   – In standard costing, material is applied at the standard cost in the parts’ database. Any 
difference between the purchase price of the material and the standard is taken as a variance when 
the Purchase Receiver is matched to the invoice in A/P Invoice entry. Labor and burden are applied 
based on the standard rates obtained from the shop resource.
Actual – With actual costing, cost information is collected as it occurs. In Accounting Entity 
Maintenance, you must specify the source of the raw material cost. The two options for Source of 
Raw Material Cost are:
Costs and Accounts
Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide | 5 – 27• A/P Invoicing
• Purchase Order
A/P Invoice Based  – Until you enter the invoice and VISUAL matches it to the receipt, A/P Invoice-
based material costs are valued at purchase order dollar amounts. As the receipts are costed at 
actual invoice prices, the corresponding issues for these material receipts are then costed at the 
actual price. Because the actual cost is not known until invoiced, the standard cost is used from the 
part’s database as a temporary value. When the actual value becomes available, VISUAL creates 
adjustment distributions (if the previous standard was posted to G/L) for the difference between the 
estimated (standard) cost and the actual cost.
Purchase Order Based  – Purchase Order based material costs use the value from the purchase 
order. When the actual invoice is received and matched to the purchase order receipt, any difference 
between the purchase order and the invoice value is booked as a purchase price variance.
If you are costing at invoice value and the material requirement for a job is linked to a purchase order, 
the material is issued directly to the job upon receipt. Material is temporarily valued at the purchase 
order price, not the part standard. Materials that are purchased under an actual cost system not for a 
specific job are valued based on the First In First Out (FIFO) method of inventory valuation.
Actual costing uses the employee labor rate to cost labor transactions. Burden costs are applied 
based on the rates set up for the shop resource. This can be established based on one or a 
combination of these costs:
• Cost per Setup time
• Cost per Run time
• Cost per Unit produced
• Fixed Cost per Resource
• Percent of Setup and / or Run labor costs
There is a delay in the final determination of a work order cost when using actual costing. Before a 
final cost can be calculated, these conditions must be met:
• All operations are completed
• All material requirements are issued to the work order
• All material issues are fully costed (receipts for which the material came from have been costed,
i.e. invoice received or sub work order receipt costed)
• The work order is closed
What is Actual and Projected Cost?
Actual cost  is the true value of the material and labor charged to a work order. Material value is 
based on the FIFO cost layers established when materials are purchased and / or subassemblies are 
finished and received into stock. Labor value is based on the rate per employee(s) working on the job 
and the number of hours worked by the employee(s). Burden cost is calculated based on the 
parameters, for each shop resource used, as defined in Shop Resource Maintenance.
Costs and Accounts
5 – 28 | Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide Projected cost  is calculated as the actual cost charged to the work order plus the remaining cost 
based on the operations and material requirements to be completed at the estimated costs. Material 
requirement costs to be completed are calculated based on the actual number of parts issued to the 
work order. If the material issues, per requirement, are equal to or greater than the estimated material 
requirement, VISUAL considers this complete. In other words actual will equal projected cost for this 
requirement.
If the material issued to a job is less than that required per estimate, VISUAL considers this 
requirement incomplete and calculates a remaining cost based on the remaining quantity to be issued 
at estimated cost.
Labor requirements to complete are based on the quantity you enter in the quantity complete field or 
a calculated quantity complete if the system is set to automatically compute quantity complete based 
on hours. The remaining cost is calculated for each requirement, based on the remaining units to 
complete, at the estimated hours multiplied by the estimated labor and burden rates.
Determining Whether Actual Cost or Projected Cost is Used
Projected unit cost is calculated as Projected Cost / Desired Qty. This unit cost is then multiplied by 
the Received Quantity for a total Projected cost of the received quantity.
The total projected cost from this calculation is then compared to the total actual costs charged to the 
work order. If the total actuals are greater than the calculated projection of the received quantity, this 
projected cost is the value used for the quantity received. If total actual costs are less than projected, 
the actual cost is the value used for the quantity received.
If the quantity received is equal to or greater than the desired quantity, actual costs are used.
See earlier in this chapter, for more information on Component Level Costing.
Manufacturing Cost Flow Overview
VISUAL implements actual costs for work orders as a function of inventory and labor transactions 
placed against those work orders. All costs ultimately come from these two window controls.
When you first create a work order, it has no transactions. As inventory is issued and labor is posted 
to the work order, the work order is given actual cost. Depending on the costing method you have 
chosen for your system, the values used in these transactions are either based on part and resource 
standards or actuals. Purchase orders, when received, effectively have an actual cost also. Similarly, 
Customer orders, when shipped, have actuals associated with them. Just as work orders can be 
shown to have an actual cost by totaling the issues and labor against it, so can a purchase order and 
customer order by totaling the receipts and shipments, respectively, against them.
The Costing Utilities prepare inventory and labor transactions to be permanently Costed and Posted 
to the General Ledger. Not all costing actions can be carried out on-line—for example, during normal 
system interaction. A few actions must be performed in batch mode. The Costing Utilities program is 
designed to perform those batch functions. The functions performed are:
• Receipt Transaction Costing (Work Orders)
Costs and Accounts
Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide | 5 – 29• Inventory Transaction Costing
• Prepare Purchase Journal Transactions
• Prepare WIP / FG Journal Transactions
• Prepare Shipments Journal Transactions
• Prepare Part Adjustment Journal Transactions
• Prepare Indirect Tx Journal Transactions
Purchase Receipts
Frequently run, daily or every other day Receipt Transaction Costing and Inventory Transaction 
Costing. As purchase order receipts become invoiced and entered, the Inventory Transaction Costing 
function takes the invoice cost information and costs the transactions that are being held because of 
missing cost information (received Purchase Order not yet invoiced). The Receipt Transaction 
Costing function checks open work orders and their receipts to “see” if all receipts can be costed. For 
example, when an invoice is matched to its receipt, that receipt can now be costed and any issue 
from that receipt (FIFO) can be costed. The costed issue has now affected the cost of a Work Order 
or Customer Shipment. In the case of the Work Order, the receipt of the finished product can now be 
valued with its final cost. The Receipt Transaction Costing function performs this step.

Indirect Labor is reclassed from Payroll to Manufacturing Indirect Payroll.

Costing Utilities – Running Receipt Transaction Costing (Work 
Order Receipts)
A work order gathers actual cost from labor ticket postings or inventory transactions throughout its 
life; however, the majority of the time its final actual cost is unknown. When the work order becomes 
fully received or shipped, it is closed. After it becomes closed, the Receipt Transaction Costing 
function permanently costs receipts for the work order. When the permanent cost is established, the 
outgoing transactions can be costed (Issues of Work Order Receipts).
Run Receipt Transaction Costing if you are using either actual or standard costing. In actual costing, 
this option evaluates the total order to “see” if all inventory transactions and operations have been 
completed and final costed. If competed, this selection assigns a permanent cost to the receipt and 
marks the work order as closed. If the work order is reopened at a later date, this option reevaluates 
the work order for any cost changes and updates the receipt as needed. The issues from that receipt 
are also updated.
In standard costing, this option determines the Manufacturing Variance that is taken. All receipts in a 
standard cost system are valued at standard as soon as they are created. Depending upon costs 
incurred in WIP, a variance will be taken for any deviation from standard.
Receipt Transaction Costing performs these actions:
Costs and Accounts
Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide | 5 – 31• Examines newly created labor transactions and inventory transactions of any permanently costed
work order to “see” if changes have occurred since the work order became permanently costed. If
you have added any new transactions, the corresponding work order is no longer permanently
costed and is now reconsidered for costing.
Examines each work order that is not permanently costed and determines if the work order is 
costable. A work order can be permanently costed if these conditions are met:
• The order is fully received or marked closed.
• The operations of the order are fully reported or marked completed.
• The material requirements of the order are fully issued or marked completed.
• The material issue transactions of the order are fully costed. Invoices have been received and
matched to receipts consumed by this work order.
If the work order being examined is costable, VISUAL takes its actual cost, determines the unit cost 
for each cost category (MLBS) and saves the result in each inventory receipt of the work order. Then 
it marks the work order as costed permanently (by setting COSTED_DATE to the current system date 
/ time in the Work Order table).
• The first option allows you to assume that all operations and requirements for a work order are
closed if the work order is closed (fully received to stock), regardless of the complete status of the
individual requirements and operations. All material issues to the work order however, must have
a final cost. For example, a work order may require 100 pieces of an item per the estimate. If 90
pieces have been issued and fully costed, this option assumes that the job can be final costed.
• The second option allows the Receipt and Inventory Transaction costing to continue to run until
you have performed all updates to transactions. This box is checked by default. VISUAL is able to
capture all activity for a change in a Transaction in one step rather than having to run this multiple
times. For example, in actual costing, if an issue to a work order id fully costed by matching the
Accounts Payable Invoice with the Purchase Order Receiver, the work order that received the
material is considered for full cost. If the work order is closed, the receipt of the work order is fully
costed and therefore, any issue (shipment or issue to a higher level work order) of the received
work order, can now be costed. If this box is not checked, the receipt is not fully costed, and
therefore, the issue of the fabricated item to a higher level work order is not costed.
A single pass (box not checked) first values receipts, and then the issues from those receipts. 
Because some receipts first require that issues are valued, a single pass does not always cost 
everything that can be valued. You should leave this option checked. The only time it is not necessary 
to leave this option checked is if all Bills of Materials for the product you fabricate are single level, 
and, very few returns are made. Check this when costing inventory at month’s end. When the No 
Updates Performed message appears, all activity to date has been costed. Under normal 
circumstances, you should leave both of these options checked.
Inventory Transaction Costing
The Inventory Transaction option from the Costing Utilities window causes incoming transactions to 
be related to outgoing transactions. Incoming costs represented by purchased part receipts or 
adjustments to inventory are matched to outgoing costs represented by material issues, shipments, 
and adjustments to inventory. Before any costs can be assigned to an outgoing transaction, VISUAL 
must first have a permanent cost for an incoming transaction.
Costs and Accounts
5 – 32 | Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide The primary source of incoming costs is the purchased part receipt. Another source of incoming costs 
is a work order receipt from work in process. We already know that labor tickets are given a 
permanent cost when they are created. Purchased part receipts may not be given a permanent cost 
at any time of receipt. If costs for purchase part receipts are identified from Purchase Orders, then the 
transaction is given its final value upon creation. If costs for purchased part receipts are identified 
from A/P Invoices, then the transaction must wait for its permanent cost until the matching A/P Invoice 
is entered. After the purchased part inventory receipt is given its final, permanent value, costs are 
distributed from that transaction. This is done by connecting the receipt to one or more outgoing 
transactions for the same part. For example, a receipt of 1000 parts can be distributed to an issue of 
1000 parts, 10 issues of 100 parts, or 1000 issues of 1 part, or any combination in between.
The order of assignment of transactions is First-In, First-Out (FIFO).
The Inventory Transaction Costing function examines each inventory part’s incoming inventory 
transactions that have not been fully distributed and assigns them to the same part’s outgoing 
inventory transactions that have not been previously assigned.
VISUAL maintains a table where it can locate all affected transactions when a given value has 
changed. For instance, a change to an A/P Invoice after its original entry would potentially have an 
affect which proceeds all the way to the Cost of Goods Sold account, assuming that the finished part 
which used the purchased part being costed has already been shipped.
As purchased part receipts are costed, material issues are costed. In turn, material issues are part of 
the cost of a work order. The cost of these material issues affects the receipt costs for parts coming 
from the work order. After all details of the work order are costed, the receipts of the work order can 
be costed. Those costs are then distributed to either material issue costs (when the part is used in the 
fabrication of another work order) or to shipment costs (when the part is a finished good and is 
shipped to a customer). The process of costing inventory transactions spirals up the bill of material 
and routing (i.e. engineering structure) until it becomes part of inventory or cost of goods sold.
Preparing Manufacturing Journals
Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide | 5 – 33Preparing Manufacturing Journals
Manufacturing Journals are prepared by the Costing Utility application. Each journal is the result of an 
analysis of inventory transactions, and if applicable, labor tickets. These procedures create summary 
journal transactions called distributions, which are then ready for posting to the General Ledger. Each 
journal is a subsidiary journal similar in nature to the Accounts Payable or Accounts Receivable 
journals. The journals must be posted using the Post Manufacturing Journals function.
If you are licensed to use multiple sites, prepare manufacturing journals on a site-by-site basis.
The Costing Utility may create several distributions for each order. If an order is open for more than 
one period, it typically has multiple distributions. If you run the Costing Utilities more than once during 
the period and post the results, multiple distributions are created. The Costing Utilities remove any 
unposted transactions for the period being processed and replace them with up to date transactions. 
This simplifies the resulting distributions allowing a summary to occur across all available 
transactions. If you run the Costing Utilities and do not post the results, the unposted transactions are 
picked up in a subsequent batch the next time you run the Costing Utilities. However, you do not lose 
the distributions created by the previous Costing Utility run. They are added to the current distribution.
Any difference between what you are posting on the Work In Process (WIP) journal and Indirect 
Labor journal and the labor expense that results from your payroll transactions can usually be 
accounted for as one of these possible situations:
• You are not entering all transactions in VISUAL. Sometimes indirect labor is not entered as a
labor ticket in VISUAL.
• Your payroll system’s employee rate information is different from the employee rate used by
VISUAL.
• Your office or salaried employee expense is mixed with the direct/indirect labor posting being
made from your payroll system.
Labor tickets are costed immediately when created. Therefore, there is no delay in obtaining this 
information. Also, burden is calculated at labor ticket creation.
Material burden is applied only when a material is issued to a work order. It is not intended to capture 
inventory storage costs, nor does it affect the value of inventory as it waits for use. The act of issuing 
the material to a work order causes the work order to be burdened for the material. This cost appears 
in the Burden column of a work order. Each part received from the work order contains a share of the 
burden applied as a result of this process. This material burden can be in addition to the burden 
applied from the shop resource. For more information on Burden Issue, refer to the Part Maintenance 
chapter.
When a material issue to a work order drives the on-hand quantity for a part into negative numbers, 
this occurs in an Actual cost database:
Material Cost  – Only the quantity that was actually on hand is costed to the work order. The 
additional quantity issued that drove the on-hand quantity into negative numbers is issued at the 
standard costs defined in Part Maintenance. If you are licensed to use multiple sites, these costs are 
defined on a site-by-site basis.
Issue Burden  – Issue Burdens are handled as:
•Unit Burden  – Because this figure is based on the number of pieces issued, the unit burden for
the total quantity issued is costed.
Preparing Manufacturing Journals
5 – 34 | Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide •Percent Burden  – This figure is based on a percentage of the material cost.
There are six Manufacturing Sub-Ledger Journals. Each of these journals are discussed in this 
section.
• Purchase Receipts Journal (PUR) – Order Based
• Work Order Journal (WIP) – Order Based
• Finished Goods Receipt Journal (FG) – Order Based
• Shipments Journal (SLS) – Order Based
• Inventory Adjustment Journal (ADJ) – Transaction Based
• Indirect Labor Journal (IND) – Transaction Based
Purchase Journals
Purchase Journals use the site on the Purchase Order line to determine which site owns the 
purchase transaction costs. Since you can enter a purchase order for multiple sites, this ensures that 
the correct site owns the costs associated with its purchasing activity.
The Purchase Journal contains a listing of the summary transactions created by the Costing Utilities. 
These summary transactions are the results of processing inventory transactions of purchase orders 
and receipts of services from the vendor that are linked to a Purchase Order. These are receipts (or 
returns) of each part.
Each purchase order received (or returned) during the period is examined for its current value by 
summing the inventory receipts attached to the purchase order. These receipts are summarized by G/
L account number for each PO. In other words, if three lines on a PO were received at $100.00 each 
and the debiting G/L account was the same, a sub-ledger distribution for this PO would be made for 
$300.00. However, if each debiting account was different, three sub-ledger distributions would be 
made for $100.00 each. Any existing distributions which have been posted for the period are 
deducted. The resulting distribution is then saved for the purchase order.
The purchase journals taken together for a given period represent the total purchase receipts for all 
types of purchases of manufacturing material and expense items for that period.
Purchase Receipt Journals
The Purchase Order accrual account from the G/L Interface is used for all Purchase Order receipts. 
This account is debited when the A/P Invoice is matched to the Purchase Order Receipt. If a 
Purchase Order line item is linked to job requirement(s), this journal posts the receipt and the WIP 
journal posts the automatic issue that occurs when the Purchase Order is received.
Preparing Manufacturing Journals
Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide | 5 – 35Work In Process (WIP) Journals
The Work In Process Journal contains a listing of the summary transactions created by the Costing 
Utilities as a result of processing inventory transactions and labor tickets to work orders. These are 
issues (or returns) of materials and posting of labor to work orders during the period.
Each work order that has material issued (or returned) to it, or labor entered for it, during the period is 
examined for its current value. The actual value of a work order comes entirely from inventory 
transactions and labor tickets. Any existing distributions that have been posted are deducted from the 
current value, and the difference is made into a new distribution for the work order. This journal is 
order based and not transaction based.
The WIP journals taken together for a given period represent the total usage of material and the total 
value added by the manufacturing process for that period.
Miscellaneous charges posted to the job from payables are posted to the general ledger via the 
Accounts Payable Invoice journal. However, these values are relieved from WIP when the order is 
received to finished goods or shipped.
The value that VISUAL determines for labor and burden in this journal are absorbed labor and 
burden. Absorbed labor and burden are temporarily placed in Work In Process Inventory, and 
ultimately flow into Finished Goods Inventory, and then finally to Cost of Goods Sold.
Finished Goods Journals
The Finish Goods Journal contains a listing of the summary transactions created by the Costing 
Utilities as a result of processing inventory transactions of work orders. These are receipts (or 
returns) of manufactured parts from the floor to finished goods inventory. This journal is work order 
based and not transaction based.
Finished Goods Journals in Actual WIP Costing
If you selected Actual as your WIP costing method, the system values that transaction at the total 
accumulated cost on the work order at that time when a partial quantity is moved from WIP to finished 
goods. If another partial quantity moves to stock, the system values that transaction with the costs 
accumulated between the previous transaction and this one. This continues until the work order is 
completed and closed. When the work order is closed, the Costing Utilities evaluate the total cost of 
the work order versus completed transactions and creates adjustment distributions for any 
differences.
Finished Goods Journals in Projected WIP Costing
If you selected Projected as your WIP costing method, the system values that transaction at the 
estimated unit cost based on the work order at that time when a partial quantity is moved from WIP to 
finished goods. 
Preparing Manufacturing Journals
5 – 36 | Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide Costing Considerations for Finished Goods Returns
If you use FIFO by Part Location as the FIFO method, review this information to ensure that work 
order receipts and returns are processed as anticipated.
FIFO locations are not maintained for finished goods returns. To make sure that FIFO layers are 
matched for finished goods return transactions, it is highly recommended that you use one 
warehouse location per work order for work order receipts and potential finished goods returns. You 
do not need to use one warehouse location for all of your work orders. You should just make sure that 
for any given work order, you use the same location for work order receipts as you do for  finished 
goods returns.
If business needs dictate that you need to use a different warehouse location for receipts and returns, 
you should review and physically adjust locations after you create  finished goods returns. If you 
receive a quantity from a work order to one location, transfer the quantity to a second location, then 
return the quantity to the work order, the relationship between the adjust out  FIFO layers will be lost. 
The distribution for the transfer to the second location and the original receipt will be separated. The 
receipt return is directly distributed to the original receipt.
If you do need to use different warehouse locations for work order receipts and returns, you can use 
these reports to analyze the transactions:
Inventory Transaction Report  – Use this report to view when work order returns have been made. 
Sort the report by Work Order and Type of Receipt to identify receipts. Negative amounts indicate 
returns.
You can also use this report, sorted by Warehouse/Location/Part, to analyze part location quantity. 
The layer costs are expressed as current value, not as the value as of a particular point in time.
Costing Tools  – You can use the Cost Distribution Analysis tool and FIFO/Average Costing Analysis 
tool to view distributions.
Inventory Balance Report – Use this report to view costed values of transactions as of a period end. 
The total of this report will reconcile, but if you use separate locations for work order receipts and 
returns, the amounts reported by location will not reconcile.
Shipments Journals
The Shipments Journal contains a listing of the summary transactions created by the Costing Utilities 
as a result of processing inventory transactions of customer orders. These are shipments (or returns) 
for parts sold to customers. This is a customer order based sub-ledger and is not transactional.
Shipments can occur for items stocked in finished goods or, if the customer order is linked to the work 
order, directly from the work order. If the product is shipped from finished goods, the value booked to 
cost of goods sold is the value booked to finished goods from the Finished Goods journal on a FIFO 
basis.
Shipping Journals in Actual WIP Costing
If you selected Actual as your WIP costing method and a partial shipment of a customer order linked 
to a work order is made, the system books to cost of goods sold the total cost accumulated to date on 
the work order. A second shipment will be at the cost accumulated between the previous shipment 
Preparing Manufacturing Journals
Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide | 5 – 37and this one. When the final shipment is made and the work order closed, if there is any difference 
between the total cost of the work order and the costs already transacted, the system creates 
adjustment distributions for this difference.
Because of this methodology, if partial shipments occur across accounting periods, there is the 
potential that cost of goods sold in a particular period may be under or over stated.
In actual costing it is possible that cost variances for a job are posted in a period for which no 
shipment was made.
For example, if an order with a total value of $4,000 ships in February, this value is posted to the Cost 
of Goods Sold account(s). If an invoice for material used on the job comes in on March 15, any 
difference in cost (Purchase value vs. Invoice) is posted to the current periods Cost of Goods Sold.
Shipping Journals in Projected WIP Costing
If you selected Projected as your WIP costing method and a partial shipment of a customer order 
linked to a work order is made, the system values that transaction at the estimated unit cost based on 
the work order at that time when a partial quantity is moved from WIP to finished goods.
Inventory Adjustment Journals (Adjust In or Out)
This journal contains a listing of the summary transactions created by the Costing Utilities as a result 
of processing inventory transactions of parts that adjusted inventory quantity on hand. This journal 
also includes transactions created from inter branch transfers and other actions that result in an 
adjust in or adjust out inventory transaction.
You must value incoming adjustments (increases in quantity on hand) when costing at actual. Use the 
current standard from the Part Master or override the value manually when the transaction is created. 
This action provides a cost per unit and therefore a total cost for every incoming adjustment 
transaction. All adjustments into inventory created by the Physical Inventory module are made at 
standard. Therefore, it is extremely important that all item masters contain a standard if you use the 
physical inventory module.
Adjustments that are outgoing (decreases in quantity on hand) must be valued by the same inventory 
costing method used to distribute costs from receipts to issues (Costing Utilities, Inventory 
Transaction Costing). You cannot set the dollar value of an outgoing adjustment.
This journal totals the value of each such transaction and posts it to the financials via this subsidiary 
ledger. This journal is transactional. That is, each transaction results in a separate distribution to the 
appropriate accounts.
Indirect Labor Journals
The Indirect Labor journal contains a listing of the summary transactions created by the Costing 
Utilities as a result of processing labor tickets which are not for a specific work order.
Preparing Manufacturing Journals
5 – 38 | Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide Indirect labor tickets are posted transactionally, in a manner similar to the adjustment journal covered 
earlier in this chapter.
Example Postings for Journals
The account used is based on how you elect to implement your system. You can use a lowest level 
G/L interface account or specify the accounts to use at the Part, Work Order, or Product Code level. 
This should be decided early on in the implementation of the system.
These transaction templates are used for each journal type:
Purchase Receipt Journals
Use the Product Code Account table, then part inventory account if the line item expense account is 
left blank. If the PO line item account, the Product Code Part Inventory or the part inventory accounts 
are blank, the Default Inventory account in the G/L Interface is used.
The PO accrual account from the G/L Interface is used for all PO receipts. This account is credited 
when the A/P Invoice is matched to the Purchase Order Receipt.
When a Purchase Order line item is linked to job requirement(s), the journal posts the receipt and the 
WIP journal posts the automatic issue that occurs when the PO is received.
Work Order Journals
• For debit transactions, first attempts to use work order WIP accounts, then the Product Code WIP
accounts, and then default WIP accounts from the General Ledger Interface table.
• For credit transactions, first attempts to use shop resource absorption account, then default
absorption accounts from the General Ledger Interface table.
Finished Goods Receipts Journals
• For debit transactions, use the part accounts, then the Product Code accounts, then default
inventory accounts from the General Ledger Interface table.
• For credit transactions, first attempts to use work order WIP accounts, then the Product Code
accounts, then default WIP accounts from the Interface table.
• Manufacturing variance account from the Product Code Interface table, then the General Ledger
Account Interface (standard cost only).
Preparing Manufacturing Journals
Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide | 5 – 39Sales (Shipments) Journals
• For debit transactions, first attempts to use line item COGS accounts from the Customer Order
Entry, then the Product Code COGS Account, then default COGS accounts from the General
Ledger Interface table.
• For credit transactions, first attempts to use the part accounts, then the Product Code Account,
then default inventory accounts from the General Ledger interface table.
Inventory Adjustment Journals
• For debit transactions, first attempts to use the part accounts, then the Product Code accounts,
then default inventory accounts from the General Ledger.
• For credit transactions, first attempts to use the account specified by the user in the Inventory
Transaction, then the default Adjustment Account from the Product Code table, and then the
default Inventory Adjustment Account from the Interface table.
Indirect Labor Journals
• For debit transactions, first attempts to use the account specified by the user in the Labor
transaction, then default indirect labor account from the General Ledger Interface table.
• Uses the Factory Payroll Account from the General Ledger Interface table.
Note that each template attempts to apply a specific account, usually an overridden account entered 
by the user for the specific order or the Product Code table, and then falls back on the interface 
account as the default. Thus, the user must setup the interface in the event that an account is not 
overridden.
If you override one account in the specific category but leave the other accounts blank, the interface 
table accounts are used for the blank fields. To ensure that you always get the result you expect, 
override all four accounts, even if it is the same account in each category.
In entries that end with (s) in the templates above, signifying more than one account, more than one 
transaction may be produced based on the user’s specified account numbers. Every attempt is made 
to eliminate duplicate accounts on either side of the transaction.
Reporting Invoices Charged Directly to Work Orders
Use the Work Order Cost Report as a means of tracking direct charges to the work order from the A/P 
Invoice by Comparative Totals and Comparative Totals with breakdown. Direct Charges involve 
Material and Service only.
For each material requirement and operation, this information is shown:
• Quantity
• Estimated Cost = Estimated Material + Labor + Burden + Service
• Actual Cost = Actual Material + Labor + Burden + Service
Preparing Manufacturing Journals
5 – 40 | Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide • Variance = Estimated – Actual
• Projected = Projected Material + Labor + Burden + Service
Comparative Totals with Breakdowns include Material, Labor, Burden and Service costs broken out 
into separate sections before being totaled. Invoices charged directly to the Work Order are also 
listed separately. Additionally, setup time and run times are split for operations.
Manually Running Costing in the Costing Utilities Window
Use the Costing Utilities window to run costing manually at any time. You can also set up a service to 
run costing. See "Running Costing with the Costing Service" on page 5–42 in this guide.
There are two sections to the Costing Utilities window. The upper portion is used to update costs 
related to Work Orders and inventory transactions. If you are running VISUAL without VISUAL 
Financials, you need only to select these two options.
The bottom half of the Costing Utilities window is where you can have the system prepare the 
manufacturing journals. Even though the window has a message that says to run these on a monthly 
basis, that is meant as a minimum. It is recommended that these journals be prepared and posted on 
a more frequent basis during the month to reduce the amount processing required to close your 
month. The frequency depends on the amount of activity generated by your business.
The default posting date that appears in the dialog box is the last fiscal period’s ending date. You can 
overwrite this field to enter another (appropriate) date (i.e. current system or month end date). If you 
enter a current period date and the prior period is open, VISUAL prompts you with a message stating 
that you cannot process the current period information until you close the previous period. This is to 
prevent any information not posted in the previous period from being posted in the current period.
For example, if on the last day of the month, you enter transactions but do not post, and on the 10th 
day of the new month you elect to post the new month's activity, all transactions not recorded in the 
journals for the current and previous month are recorded and posted to the current period.
The reason for this is that costs are posted according to the value of the order (Purchase Order, 
Customer Order or Work Order) and not the individual transactions. The transactions are used to tell 
VISUAL when the change took place so that the current value of the order can be posted to the period 
for which the transaction took place.
For example, if a Purchase Order is received on the last day of the month for $100.00, the Costing 
Utility posts $100.00 to the inventory account for that period. If on the 10th day of the new month, an 
invoice is matched to the receiver for $110.00, the variance of $10.00 will be posted in the new month 
because the previous month is closed. To post these variances to the previous month, you must 
reopen the month and run the Costing Utilities up through the end of the previous month. All 
variances for activity occurring in the previous month(s) will be posted to the month reopened. The 
Costing Utilities ignore all activity after that date.
It is also recommended that you complete the final preparation of journals for the prior period before 
you prepare journals for the current period. Post Manufacturing Balance reports could be impacted if 
a new period is prepared before the last preparation of a prior period's journal.

Running Costing with the Costing Service
You can use the Costing Service to run costing automatically on the days and times you specify. If 
you have multiple sites and would like to run the service for all sites, then you must install the service 
once for each site. 
To specify when to run the service, use the Costing Service Schedule dialog in the Costing Utilities 
window. You can specify one schedule for running inventory costs options and a separate schedule 
for preparing manufacturing journals. You can use the service to run costing up to six times a day. 
You can set up one costing schedule for each site. Users that have access to the Costing Service 
Schedule dialog in the Costing Utilities window can edit the schedule for their allowable sites. The 
system administrator can control which users have access to the Costing Service dialog. 
After the service is installed and the service schedule is set up, the database is examined based on 
the polling interval you specify to see if costing needs to be run. When the service finds that costing 
needs to be run, the service runs costing based on the settings you specify in the Set as Scheduled 
dialog. 
If you prepare manufacturing journals with the Costing Service, you must post the journals manually 
using the Post Manufacturing Journals window. The Costing Service does not post manufacturing 
journals. 
If you set up the Costing Service, you can still run costing utilities manually. 
Preparing Manufacturing Journals Using the Costing Service
You can use the Costing Service to run costing only in the current period or the period immediately 
prior to the current period. In both cases the period prior to the period in which you are running 
costing must be closed. 
For example, presume you use a monthly financial calendar. Today is April 24th and the service is 
scheduled to run. This table shows scenarios when the Costing Service can be used and when the 
costing service cannot be used:

WIP / Costing – Table Related Discussion
Every transaction in VISUAL affects one or more database tables. Some database tables hold detail 
transaction records from original sources of entry, for example, purchases, inventory transactions, 
labor tickets, payable entries. Other database tables record and hold summary information for other 
programs as well as reports to use as a feed of information. Summary database tables reduce the 
amount of work the system needs to do to produce accounting entries as well as provide report 
information. Because the same data is written in various forms to various tables in the database, it is 
important to keep these tables synchronized.
There are basically three kinds of database tables used to track costing related information—the 
bridge between manufacturing and financials.
Transaction Tables  – Transaction tables hold transaction level information. These tables form the 
underlying cost information that the costing utilities use to populate the other tables it needs to keep 
track of WIP details, G/L postings and WIP balances.
Hosting Tables  – VISUAL stores all of your debit and credits in hosting tables.
Summary Tables  – Summary tables record and hold summary information for other programs as well 
as reports to use as a feed of information.

historical balances for tracking currency accounts based on either the exchange rate when the 
transaction originated or the system date when the transaction originated, depending upon your

5 – 50 | Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide Tracking costs of materials by currency is provided by the tracking currency feature. Because the 
material cost is quantitative it is processed at it’s historical value. You can run costing utilities as often 
as needed (perhaps daily) for purposes of applying Labor and Burden. All Labor and Burden (indirect) 
costs use the rate in existence based on the transaction date or system date as defined in Accounting 
Entity Maintenance.
Cost Movements
VISUAL accumulates the appropriate currency values from Inventory or Service Charges and 
Estimated Bookings to calculate material costs. Each quantitative cost is tracked at its historical 
currency rate / value at the time of transaction entry to a work order based on the exchange rate 
dates for applying the exchange rate as set in Accounting Entity Maintenance.
Inventory Valuation
VISUAL values inventory using the FIFO (First In, First Out) method. The FIFO method of inventory 
valuation assigns cost to inventory in cost layers. Each addition (purchase, inventory receipt, or 
adjust-in) adds a new cost layer. Each subtraction (issue, sale, or adjust-out) removes one or more 
cost layers. For every tracking currency held by the database, VISUAL records and tracks all cost 
movements through the manufacturing process, from inventory through to cost of goods sold.
There are two types of FIFO layers held within the system. First, raw material inventory contains 
layers via purchases from a supplier or they can be created when an issue return is created from 
work-in-process back to inventory (in the case of an over issue). Second, work-in-process can also 
contain FIFO layers where multiple inventory issues for the same part on a work order is contained in 
work-in-process.
Included below are examples to depict transaction flows in an actual cost database. In a standard 
cost database all inventory transactions are performed at the standard rate and therefore their 
computed issue costs carry the same value as the FIFO inventory layers.
FIFO Layers from Purchases
Every receipt of raw material inventory or finished goods inventory (a distinction is not made) is 
assigned a per unit price value. Raw material inventory FIFO layers are created when a purchase is 
received into inventory. The cost of the purchased inventory is derived by the number of units 
received times the per unit cost as identified on the purchase order. This value also represents the 
purchase order accrual value. Tracking currency values are assigned based on the receipt date or 
system date as designated in Accounting Entity Maintenance. Each purchase creates a unique layer 
of inventory, which is displayed by the inventory valuation report.
Preparing Manufacturing Journals
Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide | 5 – 51FIFO Layers from Issue Returns
Issue returns (parts issued to a work order returned to inventory) also create a FIFO layer. When 
parts are issued to a work order their costs are added to work-in-process based on the raw material 
FIFO layer they originated from. If the issue to WIP is derived from more than one layer then the costs 
of all the layers issued to fulfill the requirement are combined together to create a single WIP issue 
layer. Any subsequent issue of the same part to a work order creates an additional WIP issue layer. If 
a part on the work order is returned to inventory from work-in-process, a new cost layer is created 
with the layers value being derived from the WIP issue layers currently residing on the work order. If 
there is only one issue of a particular part for the work order the cost is straightforward. It being, the 
average unit cost (by combining original FIFO layers) times the number of units returned to inventory. 
When there is more than one raw material inventory “issue” to a work order the costs are returned 
from the WIP issue layers in FIFO order.
FIFO Layers from Receipts and/or Adjust-In
A receipt of inventory (finished goods) from a work order can also cause FIFO layers in inventory to 
occur. The cost of the inventory layer is derived from the average unit cost on the work order times 
the number of units. If the receipt closes the work order (complete receipts) the entire cost of the work 
order at the time of the receipt is the value of the FIFO layer.
Adjustments into inventory create a separate cost layer in inventory for the per unit cost assigned 
during inventory transaction entry. If no cost is assigned at that time, the cost is derived by the unit 
cost as set on the part master file when you run costing utilities.
Multi-Currency System Cost Flow
Inventory Transactions
There are eight classes of inventory transactions. Each of these transactions either move goods in or 
out of inventory or transfers between inventory locations, therefore making 16 possible transaction 
types. Most transactions affecting inventory, with the exception of transfers, either adds or removes 
costs from inventory. All movements applied are based on historical currency levels.
Preparing Manufacturing Journals
5 – 52 | Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide Basic Transaction Types
P/O Receipts
P/O Receipts are purchased items received into stock. When you receive P/Os you assign them to an 
inventory warehouse location. The number of units purchased as well as the cost of the purchased 
part(s) become a new cost layer of raw materials inventory. When the PO Receipt is received into 
inventory, the entry is booked to a purchase accrual, as a credit with the offsetting debit to Inventory.
You can assign purchase inventory parts directly to a work order. When you receive these parts you 
book to raw materials inventory and immediately issue to the corresponding work order. The 
inventory transaction entry report depicts this process. Purchased parts that are purchased on behalf 
of an existing work order are given the same treatment as inventory issues when received into the 
warehouse. The only time these costs become a FIFO layer is if they are received into inventory 
through an inventory issue return.
Accrual amounts on Purchase Order Receipt transactions are set in all currencies defined as tracking 
based on the exchange rate in effect and results from the exchange rate date setting defined in 
Accounting Entity Maintenance.
Services
In the same manner as purchased parts, service transactions entered as a work order can be 
purchased directly from the Manufacturing Window using the Costing Utilities function. 
In purchasing, the Service Receipts Accrual account is debited with a credit to the PO Accrual 
account. In the WIP Journal, the WIP Service account is debited and the Service Receipts Accrual 
account is credited.
Inventory Issue / Issue Returns
Inventory issues are transactions that assign raw material inventory to a specific work order. 
Inventory issues normally cause the reduction of one or more inventory layer(s). These costs become 
the basis of the material costs assigned to WIP. Inventory issue transactions are prepared by costing 
utilities to debit WIP and credit Inventory.
Issue returns are inventory parts sent back to the warehouse. Issue returns would most likely result 
from over issues or raw materials to a work order. The costing utility feature accounts for these costs 
with a credit to raw materials inventory and a debit to WIP. All movements applied are based on 
historical currency levels.
Preparing Manufacturing Journals
Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide | 5 – 53Accounts Payable
You can directly assign costs through accounts payable for items that did not go through the normal 
purchasing process. Link these costs to the work order in the Invoice Entry window. You are required 
to enter the GL code to cost the items. The GL Account assigned to an account payable invoice linked 
directly to a work order is treated as a clearing account. Costing utilities posts an offset entry to the 
GL account and applies the transaction value to WIP.
Currency overrides are based on the receipt exchange rate date as set in Accounting Entity 
Maintenance.
Warehouse Transfers
The cost implication, such as the treatment of warehouse transfers, are dependent on the setting 
applied for the FIFO method in Accounting Entity Maintenance. If the FIFO method option is set to 
track “by part transfers” from one location to another it does not have any cost implications. Inventory 
transaction entry records the movement (without cost implication) to the new location. If the FIFO 
method to track “by part location” is set VISUAL records cost movements between locations. All 
movements applied are based on historical currency levels.
Inventory Adjustments In / Out
Inventory adjustments usually originate from physical inventory counts. Typically, companies take 
physical counts to keep perpetual records in line with actual inventory on hand. Discrepancies 
between the actual inventory on hand and the perpetual records requires an adjustment, either in or 
out. If an adjustment-in is required VISUAL costs this adjustment as a new cost layer. Adjustments-
out removes costs from an existing cost layer or potentially removes an entire cost layer from 
Inventory. When entering adjustments through Inventory Transaction Entry, you are required to 
assign a G/L Account for the other side of the transaction. VISUAL knows raw materials inventory will 
be either debited or credited (depending on the adjustment type). You need to define the GL offset 
account to apply to the other side of the transaction. All movements applied are based on historical 
currency levels.
Direct Labor / Burden
Labor charges are applied directly to the labor ticket during Labor Ticket Entry either through bar 
coding or by entering via a computer terminal. All costs for setup and run times are recorded in WIP 
when you run Costing Utilities. VISUAL records the entry to direct labor in WIP as a debit to Work-in-
Process Labor and a credit to Direct Payroll Manufacturing.
Burden (overhead) represents costs associated with the cost of manufacturing without the capability 
of identifying the costs to specific operations or jobs in WIP at any one point in time. For example, 
rent, utilities, general plant maintenance, and depreciation are costs that every manufacturing 
environment incurs but are not attributable to specific jobs in WIP.
Preparing Manufacturing Journals
5 – 54 | Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide Costing provides the ability to set burden rates to capture these costs and allocate them to jobs that 
flow through WIP. You can also apply burden to raw materials inventory as well as to specific 
operations used in the manufacturing process. Burden rates applied to raw materials inventory on the 
part master file will cause burden to be charged each time that the part is issued to a work order. 
Burden costs assigned operations are applied to WIP at the time of Labor Ticket Entry.
The settings assigned on the resource in Shop Resource Maintenance are the burden costs applied 
during Labor Ticket Entry. The burden rate is derived either from the operation set in Shop Resource 
Maintenance or from the operation on the bill of materials. The determination of whether costs are 
extended from the resource or the work order depends on the Burden Basis setting as defined in 
Accounting Entity Maintenance. If the option is set to determine by resource burden, then VISUAL 
looks to the settings as defined in the Resource ID of Resource Maintenance to determine the proper 
amount of burden to apply. If the option is set to determine by operation burden, then the amounts 
applied on the work order are used to determine the amount of burden.
Indirect Labor
Indirect labor is applied in the same manner as direct labor. The only difference is the transaction type 
is set to Indirect as opposed to setup or run through the Labor Ticket Entry window. Indirect labor is 
not charged to specific jobs. Costs associated with indirect labor are reclassed from manufacturing 
payroll to the appropriate manufacturing indirect Labor G/L Accounts.
Shipments (Sales)
When you ship customer orders, work-in-process inventory costs flow through to Cost of Sales in the 
general ledger in two distinct offsetting entries. The first entry reclassifies work-in-process costs to 
finished goods inventory. The second entry records the transfer of finished goods inventory to Cost of 
Sales to properly match costs with revenue as required by generally accepted accounting principles. 
The exchange rate is based on the shipping date, or the date of invoice generation as defined in 
Accounting Entity Maintenance.
Tracking Currency Conversion Utility
Infor Global Solutions, Inc. has a built-in Tracking Currency Conversion Utility routine that is designed 
specifically to take the historical information based on the proper exchange rates in existence at the 
time of the transaction and then to convert it to create transaction detail and summary balance 
information. You can also assign appropriate individuals with the power to purge the tracking currency 
records at your request.
Preparing Manufacturing Journals
Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide | 5 – 55Adjusting Inventory Transactions
In order to set the proper value, all inventory transactions must be adjusted by a conversion 
(exchange) rate. This value equates to the inventory balance. You can enter inventory adjustment 
transactions to:
• Adjust by zero quantity.
• Set values (except system) by currency. This option is secured by SYSADM. Set the value once
and let the system take over from there properly maintaining the values.
VISUAL records the adjustment as a normal inventory transaction.
Adjusting General Journal Entries
General Journal Entries is accomplished by adjusting the inventory valuation with the inventory 
balance reports and reconciling your work-in-process accounts to properly reflect the balance by 
tracking currencies on the General Ledger.
If you need to manipulate currency values, you can post a zero value to general journal transactions 
and posts like any other journal entry.
Be CAREFUL, as these types of adjustments are very dangerous because they allow for the 
manipulation of currency data that would not be supported by an exchange rate. VISUAL has secured 
this functionality to component level security (managers, controllers, etc.) because of the 
ramifications.
What are Costing Tools/Audits?
5 – 56 | Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide What are Costing Tools/Audits?
Detail transactions provide the basis from which summary data is formed and occurs for all 
transactions and balances. Cost Accounting is a very crucial area for manufacturing concerns. 
Companies need to know manufacturing data is reflected in the VISUAL accounting system. There 
are times when this data can get out of sequence due to system failures. In order to keep the integrity 
of cost data, you can use Costing Tools to correct instances where summary records are not 
supported by detail transactions.
Use Costing Tools to visually compare detail transaction records with their corresponding summary 
records. You also have the ability to correct them immediately or set them to correct the next time you 
run costing utilities. After you run Costing Utilities, VISUAL records any necessary entries or fixes, to 
properly reflect the manufacturing accounting data in the financial system.
The Costing Tools option is located on the Admin menu. The program option is secured by read/write 
access as well as program component security. To access program security SYSADM access is 
required.
Data Inconsistencies
In today’s computing environment, sophisticated applications must include tools available to users 
(through the guidance of technical support) to assist in the maintenance and upkeep of database 
information. Typically these tools allow for the detection and correction (if appropriate) of data 
inconsistencies.
Inconsistencies are defined in the dictionary as follows:
• not in agreement, not in harmony, incompatible, 
• not uniform; self contradictory, 
• not holding to the same principles or practice
In a business environment this definition can be specifically applied to transactions (transaction 
inconsistencies) or it can be applied in a general sense to expected results in the data (data 
inconsistencies).
Therefore, when discussing inconsistencies we cover the spectrum of data inconsistencies to 
transaction inconsistencies. Data inconsistencies result when transaction values are expected to be 
picked up in one period but are actually calculated into another. Transaction inconsistencies occur 
where accumulated transaction sub-totals do not support the summation of detail transaction entries.
Typically, transaction inconsistencies occur as a result of a system crash during an update stage. 
When a transaction is entered into the system it usually causes another record to be to updated or 
added to the system. VISUAL stores “summary” records, dependent on detail transaction records. If a 
system crash occurs during a summary record update, database inconsistencies are quite likely to 
occur as well. Costing Tools can check for these inconsistencies and make appropriate modifications.
To understand data inconsistencies, and how transactions expected in one period can show up in 
another, you must first understand how costing accumulates and processes information. Typically, 
Costing Utilities assign transactions to the period in which the transaction date falls, as established in 
application global. This, however, is not consistent when transactions dated with a prior month 
What are Costing Tools/Audits?
Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide | 5 – 57transaction date (intended for the prior month) are picked up in the costing run for the current month. 
This may occur when the costing utilities feature is executed for the current month without having 
been run for the prior month. If a situation occurs where costs are posted to one period when they 
were expected to be closed to a different period, costing tools can be used to affect the proper 
change in accounting. Technical support can assist in this matter.

Recalculate options are available:
• Recalculate Distributions

Costing Tools
Costing Tools tracks and tallies various types of inventory transactions; either to a work order or to 
raw materials inventory (purchase or transfer), applied labor & burden, and/or indirect labor. All costs 
are prepared for journal entry through the Costing Utilities function. It is imperative that the links 
between the transaction held in the transaction tables, the related distribution tables, and the Work-in-
process Issue & Detail tables always support one another and more importantly tie out.

5 – 58 | Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide Using Costing Tools
To analyze your costs:
1From the Admin menu, select the Costing Tools  option.
2If you are licensed to use multiple sites, click the Site ID  arrow and select the site that contains 
the costs to check. If you are licensed to use a single site, this field is unavailable.
3Click the Cost to Check arrow and select the cost to check for inconsistencies from the list.
You can select:
Purchases  – Costing tools check purchase order lines against the appropriate detail and 
distribution (posted) transactions. Any discrepancies between the detail and posted transaction 
totals are identified by a note in the Remarks field; furthermore, the values in the rows do not 
match. 
WIP – Every transaction assigned to a work order enters and flows through the WIP tables. 
Costing Tools reconcile the WIP transactions to the records that provide the links to the necessary 
transaction tables, work orders and ultimately the GL Posting table.
Finished Goods  – Finished goods result from either work order receipts or shipments of work 
orders to customers.
When parts assigned to a work order are received into inventory (Finished Goods), the number of 
units and cost of the work order is assigned a FIFO layer in inventory. The costs associated with 
the work order are removed from WIP and classified to Inventory. When goods are shipped (if 
they are attached to a work order), VISUAL, through the Costing Utilities, first removes the cost 
from WIP and books the costs to inventory. Second, VISUAL, through the Costing Utilities, 
immediately removes this cost from inventory and books it to Cost of Goods Sold/Manufactured. If 
the goods are in inventory (finished goods) VISUAL  removes the cost of the FIFO layer(s) to the 
Cost of Goods Sold/Manufactured.
Shipments  – Shipment transactions are related to customer orders. The transaction entries 
prepared by Costing Utilities and/or posted by Post Manufacturing Journals depend on whether 
the transactions are linked customer-to- work order(s) or simply shipments for inventory.
If the shipments are for customer orders linked to one or more work orders, VISUAL closes the 
work order and transfers all costs to inventory. Subsequently the costs of the work order (now in 
inventory) are transferred to Cost of Goods Sold/Manufactured.
If a shipment is for inventory (customer orders not linked to one or more work orders), Costing 
Utilities remove costs from inventory and posts them directly to the Cost of Goods Sold/
Manufactured.
Customer orders also affect costing. As mentioned in the Finished Goods section, the shipment of 
customer orders may potentially affect full shipment status, thereby affecting the cost of open 
work orders in WIP. Shipments of customer orders or inventory ultimately remove costs from 
inventory and reclassify them to Cost of Sales.
Adjustments  – Adjustments relate to inventory corrections resulting from inconsistencies 
between the perpetual inventory records and actual quantities held in inventory. Each adjustment 
either adds an inventory cost layer (FIFO) to inventory or subsequently removes costs from one 
or more layers.

are applied, these costs are removed from the general payroll account and booked to either WIP, 
Indirect Labor, or Cost of Sales. These transactions are entered into VISUAL through the labor 
ticket entry window; the only difference is that you must set the transaction type on the labor ticket 
to Indirect as opposed to Setup or Run.
WIP Balance  – The WIP Balance account supports WIP distribution table records. If any 
corrections are required for any of the other transaction types, WIP Balance checks for database 
inconsistencies.
Note: The table columns change depending on which cost you select to check.
4In the Selection section, select the range of costs to include.
For Purchases and Shipments, enter the starting and ending Order IDs.
For WIP, Finished Goods, and WIP Balances, enter the starting and ending Base IDs.
For Adjustments and Indirect Labor, enter the starting and ending Trans IDs.

calendar button and select the date.
Note: You cannot run costing analysis for closed or invalid posting dates.
6In the Options  section, select the type of costs to display in the table.
You can select: Transactions , Detail , Balance , and Burden . As you select or clear check boxes, 
columns appear or disappear in the table.
7To process only differences between the transaction value and posted value, select the 
Exceptions Only  check box in the Options section and enter the filter criteria:
Plus/Minus %  – If the difference between the transaction value and the posted value is greater 
than the allowed Plus/Minus %  and the posting candidate flag is set to N, the transaction appears 
as an exception in the table.
For example, if a transaction worth $1.00 has a posted value of $1.11 and the Plus/Minus Percent 
is set to 10% the transaction appears in the table because the allowable 10% of $1.00 is less than 
the difference of $0.11. If a transaction worth $1.00 has a posted value of $1.09 and the Plus/
Minus Percent is set to 10% the transaction will not appear in the table because the difference 
$0.09 is less than the allowed difference of $0.10.
Plus/Minus Amount  – If the difference between the transaction value and the posted value is 
greater than the allowed Plus/Minus Amount  and the posting candidate flag is set to N, the 
transaction appears as an exception in the table.
Note: You can leave either field blank and filter on % or Amount. If you enter values in both fields, 
VISUAL filters differences based on it being an OR operator.

Printing Costing Reports
There are several reports you can print or view from within the Costing Tools window:
Cost of Goods Analysis – The Cost of Goods Analysis report provides a means to analyze your cost 
of goods sold by customer order.
Cost Distribution Analysis  – Use the Cost Distribution Analysis report to show how costs for a given 
item were issued at FIFO or how costs were distributed due to links between the Work Order 
requirement and the Purchase Order, or the Work Order and Customer Order in the case of a buy / 
resell part or manufactured part.
P/O/Accrual Analysis  – Use the P/O Accrual Analysis report to review purchase order receipts 
against the amount invoiced against those receipts.
Journal Preparation Analysis  – The Journal Preparation Analysis report examines each purchase 
order, work order, sales order, adjustment, and indirect labor ticket and attempts to determine if the 
item’s current value, based on its inventory transactions, labor tickets, service receipts, direct 
invoices, etc., is equal to the value posted to the general ledger.
Project Summary Analysis (only if you are licensed to use Projects/A&D)  – 
FIFO/Average Costing Analysis  – Use this report to analyze FIFO Distributions for transactions 
within a specified range.
You can output all costing reports to:
Print  – To send the report to your printer, select the Print  option.
View  – To view the report using the report viewer, select the View  option.
File – To send the report to text file, select the File option. VISUAL prepares your report as a CSV file 
and a dialog box appears prompting you to enter the location and file name for the file to be saved.
E-mail  – To prepare the report and attach it to an email, select the E-mail  option. VISUAL prepares 
the report as an RTF file and attaches it to a Microsoft Outlook email message. For information on 
addressing and sending the email message, refer to your Microsoft Outlook user documentation. 
Click the Send  button when you are ready to send the message.
To attach a PDF (Portable Document Format) file to your email instead of a RTF file, select the PDF

5Select the type of report to run. You can select:
Analysis Report  – Select the Analysis report to compare cost of quantity received to the cost of 
quantity shipped and posted to cost of goods sold. For each customer order, the report lists the 
Part ID shipped, the costed and shipped quantity by work order, and their values. The values on 
this report are the actuals from the work orders. With actual costing, work order costs can be 
affected across several periods, this report shows you a total cost by month for the last four 
months.
This report has an option to print for exceptions only, based on parameters you supply. By clicking 
on the Exceptions Only  check box, you can specify a Plus/Minus % deviation and / or a Plus/
Minus Amount deviation. This is a useful tool to help determine if there are any missing 
transactions or costing information.
For example, if you received an order to inventory for $1000.00 and the shipment (issue) is 
valued at $1000.00; however, the Cost of Goods Sold value is $200.00, this indicates that the 
Shipments Journal needs to be run to capture the $800.00 to Cost of Goods Sold.
Margin Report  – Select the Margin report to view the margin earned on that product by customer 
order and line item shipped. Information in the report includes ship quantity, revenue, actual cost, 
margin, estimated cost and a variance between estimated and actual cost. For each customer 
order, this report also shows you a total revenue versus total actual costs and total revenue 
versus estimated costs and the respective margins. Use this tool to highlight where costs have 
deviated from estimate and which work orders may need to be reviewed.
The option available for this report is to print all orders that affect Cost of Goods Sold for that 
period or only those orders shipped during that select period. Orders shipped in a previous period 
may affect Cost of Goods Sold in the current period due to changes to the order shipped such as 
posting of Accounts Payable Invoices or edits to Labor Tickets.

6 – 2 | Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide What is Document Maintenance?
Sometimes you may have a single document that you associate with several items. For other 
documents, you may want to associate several documents to one item. Use Document Maintenance 
to associate your documents with records in VISUAL.
By having a single window in which you can set up all of your documents and using a reference from 
the appropriate areas in VISUAL, you can better manage your documentation.
Planning Document Storage 
Documents can be stored in centralized directories by reference type, site, entity, tenant, or globally. 
Use the Document Folder feature to designate the storage folder for documents at each level. See 
“Maintaining Document Folders” on page 6-5.
If you set up specific directories for sites and reference types, we recommend that you use drag-and-
drop to add new documents and use the Document ID browse in the Document Reference dialog to 
attach existing documents to records. This prevents you from accidentally overriding the site and 
reference type checks that are in place when you: add new documents using drag-and-drop or attach 
existing documents using Document ID browse in the Document Reference dialog. 
This table describes how to achieve centralized directories for each level:
Document Storage 
LevelHow to store a document at this storage level
Reference TypeFor directories by reference type, specify a directory unique for each site or 
tenant reference type such as, 
C:\Infor\VISUAL\Docs\SiteABC\ReferenceType1 and 
C:\Infor\VISUAL\Docs\SiteABC\ReferenceType2.
SiteFor a site-level directory not subdivided by reference type, specify the 
same directory for all of the site’s reference types.
EntityFor an entity-level folder structure not subdivided by site, specify the same 
directories for all of the entity's child sites. You can still use reference types. 
For example, you could create a directory called 
C:\Infor\VISUAL\Attachments\EntityA\APInvoices and assign the directory 
to the AP Invoice reference type in each of the entity's child sites. 
TenantFor tenant-level folders, specify ** Tenant ** in the Site ID field. You can 
specify which sites have access to tenant-level documents on a document-
by-document basis. 
GlobalFor a global document folder, create a folder and then specify it in the 
Global Document Path.
What is Document Maintenance?
Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide | 6 – 3Referencing Documents at the Tenant-level and the Site-
level
When you attach documents in maintenance windows, the level of the maintenance window must 
match the level of the document. For example, Vendor Maintenance is a tenant-level application, 
because you cannot specify a site. If you attach an existing document to a Vendor Maintenance 
record, you can only attach tenant-level documents. While you can use Document Maintenance to 
create a site-specific vendor document, you cannot use this document in Vendor Maintenance. Site-
specific documents can only be used in site-specific maintenance windows such as WIP 
Maintenance. 
Similarly, when you create a new document attachment through a maintenance window, the level of 
the new document matches the level of the maintenance window. For example, if you create a new 
document in Purchase Order Entry, the document is created in the site that you selected in the 
purchase order header. If you create a new document in Customer Maintenance, the document is 
created at the tenant level.
Many of the document reference-enabled windows allow document creation at the site level. This 
table shows the windows where tenant level documents and document references are made:

Maintaining Default Reference Types
6 – 6 | Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide Maintaining Default Reference Types
Use default reference types to define how your documents are stored.
When a user drags-and-drops a new document onto a program’s main window or a Document 
Reference dialog, these settings determine the default reference type. For example, if you specify 
Customer as the default reference type for Customer Order documents, then new documents that are 
drag-and-dropped onto the Customer Order Entry window have a Customer reference type. You can 
change the reference for new dragged-and-dropped documents in the Document Reference dialog or 
in the New Document dialog. The General reference type is used when no default reference type 
exists.
To maintain default reference types:
1In the Document Maintenance window, select Maintain , Default Reference Types .
2In the Site ID field, specify the site where you are setting up default reference types. Select ** 
Tenant **  to set up default references for tenant-level documents. If you are licensed to use a

Adding Documents
Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide | 6 – 9Adding Documents
You can add documents by specifying a file location (for example, c:/Infor ERP VISUAL Enterprise/ 
Part123Schematic.doc) or a URL address (for example, file://///mycompanyserver/ 
Part123schematic.doc). Using a URL address can be helpful if you share documents with Microsoft 
Sharepoint or other similar document sharing systems.
If you add documents with a URL address, you cannot print the document using the print associated 
documents feature found in applications such as Customer Order Entry, Print Work Order Travellers, 
Customer Maintenance, Part Maintenance, and Vendor Maintenance. If you would like to be able to 
print the documents that you associate with records in these applications, specify a file location 
instead of a URL.
The system does not validate the existence of the URL you provide. Make sure you enter the URL 
correctly.
For physical file locations, you can specify a default Global Document Path for the file location in 
Document Folder Maintenance. You can also specify a file location based on Site ID and Reference 
Type. 
Adding a Document
To add a document:
1In the Document Maintenance window, use the Site ID field to specify where the document can be 
used. To use the document in a particular site, select the site from the drop-down list. To use this 
document at the tenant level, select ** Tenant ** from the drop-down list. When you add a 
document at the tenant level, the document is available to all sites by default. If you are licensed 
to use a single site, this field is unavailable. 
2Click the Reference Type  arrow and select the type of document from the list. You cannot remove 
or add Reference Types from the drop-down list. General is the default reference type.
By selecting an appropriate reference type, you can control the documents that appear in the 
various windows and thereby limit the documents from which your users can select. For example, 
if you select Part for all of your part documents and your user is referencing a document in the 
Part Maintenance window, that user will only be able to select a part document. You can reference 
General type documents from within any module.
You can select AP Invoice, AR Invoice, Customer, Customer Order, Email Attachments, 
Engineering Change Notice, Estimating, General, General Journal, Operation, Part, Project, 
Purchase Contract, Purchase Order, Receiver, RFQ, RMA, Requisition, Service, Shipper, Shop 
Resource, Trace, Vendor, Work Order, or Work Flow.
After you select a reference type, the Document Path field is updated. If a path is specified for the 
reference type and site in the Document Path Maintenance dialog, then that path is displayed in 
the Document Path field. If a path has not been specified for the reference type and site, then the 
global document path is displayed. If the global document path has not been specified, then the 
directory where you store your VISUAL executables is displayed. 
3To add the document, perform one of these actions:

Adding Documents
Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide | 6 – 11Editing Document References
You can edit your document references without having to make the changes everywhere you have 
used that reference. For example, if you have widely used a material spec and you change the 
location on the document to which the specification refers, make a single change in the Document 
Maintenance window instead of changing the reference everywhere you have used it.
To edit document references:
1In the Document Maintenance window, select the site where the document is used. Select  ** 
Tenant **  to edit a tenant-level reference.
If you select a site in the Site ID field, documents that belong to the site are displayed in the 
Documents browse. Tenant-level documents are also displayed if the site is allowed to use them.

You can change the selected site only if there are no references to the document, or if the 
document is a tenant document that only references one site and you are selecting that site.
You can change unreferenced documents from site level to tenant level, or tenant level to site 
level. If you change a document from site to tenant level the document is added to all allowable 
sites.

Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide | 6 – 21Creating Document References in Maintenance Windows
Dragged-and-dropped documents are stored based on this storage hierarchy. If a directory exists for 
tenant, site, or reference type documents, the document is stored there. If no such directory exists 
then the document is stored in the global document path as defined in the Document Folder 
Maintenance window. If folders do not exist at either of those storage hierarchy levels, then the 
documents are stored in the VISUAL executable directory.
You can add a document reference to a maintenance window by:
• Dragging and dropping the document onto one of these maintenance windows: Customer
Maintenance, Part Maintenance, Vendor Maintenance or WIP Maintenance.
• Dragging and dropping the document onto a maintenance window’s Document Reference dialog.
• Specifying a new Document ID in a maintenance window’s Document Reference dialog.
Dragging and Dropping Documents onto Maintenance Windows
You can create document references to maintenance windows using the drag-and-drop method. 
The document level, site-level or tenant-level, is determined by the window onto which you are 
dragging and dropping the document. The document’s reference type is determined by the settings 
specified in the Document Maintenance window’s Default Reference Type Maintenance dialog. The 
document’s path is determined by the settings specified in the Document Maintenance window’s 
Document Folder Maintenance dialog.
Dragging and dropping a new document is different than adding an existing document as a new 
reference for a record. New documents are created based on their default reference type. You can 
override the reference type default in the New Document dialog. New documents are assigned to a 
site or tenant; the site when it is specified in the maintenance window, or the tenant when the site is 
not specified in the maintenance window. Adding an existing document as a new reference for a 
record differs from adding a new document. An existing document must have a valid reference type 
for the application, which may differ from the default, and it must also be valid for the site or tenant 
specified in the maintenance window.
To drag-and-drop documents onto maintenance windows:
1Access the maintenance window to which you are creating the referenced document.
2Select the item. For example in Part Maintenance select the part.
3Locate the document you want referenced in the maintenance window.
4Click and hold the mouse button down to select the document, drag the mouse onto the 
maintenance window, and then release the mouse button to create a reference to the document. 
One of these dialogs is displayed:
• If the document has not yet been created as a reference and does not exist in the file location
defined for the document type, a dialog is displayed that lists the number of documents and
document references that will be created. Click Yes to create the document and reference.

Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide | 7 – 5Event Samples
These samples show how to use the Message, Query, and Tokens tabs to write messages that 
include information from the database.
Creating a Message with Database Information
This example creates a message with database information when a new customer order has been 
created. Specify Insert in the Class field and Customer Order in the Class field. Set up the remainder 
of the event trigger as you see fit. 
Enter this text in the Message tab:
A new customer order %ID Customer ID %1 PO# %2 Ship Date %3 has been 
created. Please have it shipped.
Enter this text in the Query tab:
select customer_id, customer_po_ref, desired_ship_date from 
customer_order where ID=%ID 
Enter this text in the Tokens tab:
%ID
In the Message tab, the %ID indicates that the %ID token is used in the message. If you use a token 
in the message, you must list it in the Token tab. 
The %1, %2, and %3 in the message are the placeholders for the three pieces of information you are 
extracting from the database with the query in the Query tab. 
The results output may look like this:

What is Employee Maintenance?
8 – 2 | Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide What is Employee Maintenance?
Use Employee Maintenance to:
• Create employee records
• Set up earning codes
• Set up indirect codes
• Set up shift definitions
• Assign employees to sites
Employee IDs are used on Labor Tickets. If you use the actual or average costing method, the pay 
rate you specify is used to determine labor costs.
Employees are different from users. A user can sign into the database. An employee cannot sign into 
the database unless you associate a user ID with the employee.

Defining Shifts
Before you can assign employees to shifts, you must first define the Shift IDs. Shift IDs define the 
break, lunch, and grace periods for a given shift.
You can break down Shift schedules by activities that occur during the shift. These activities include 
allowed clock-in and clock-out grace periods, between-job lag times, and break times. 
To define shifts: 
1Select Edit, Shift Definition .
Defining Codes and Shifts
8 – 6 | Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide 2In the Shift ID field, specify a unique identifier for this shift.
3In the Description field, specify a description of the shift ID.
4In the Allowed Clock In/Out Grace Periods section, specify this information:
Minutes before start of shift  – Specify the grace period before the start of the shift. If employees 
clock in during the grace period, their clock in time is adjusted to the start time of the shift.
If the start of the shift is 7:00 AM and the grace period is 5 minutes, employees clocking in 
between 6:55 and 7:00 will have a clock in time of 7:00. If they clock in at 6:54 or earlier, the 
actual clock in time is used.
Minutes after start of shift  – Specify the grace period after the start of the shift. If employees 
clock in during the grace period, their clock in time is adjusted to the start time of the shift. 
If the start of the shift is 7:00 AM and the grace period is 5 minutes, employees clocking in 
between 7:00 and 7:05 will have a clock in time of 7:00. If they clock in at 7:06 or later, the actual 
clock in time is used.
Minutes before end of shift  – Specify the grace period before the end of the shift. If employees 
clock out during the grace period, their clock out time is adjusted to the end time of the shift.
If the end of the shift is 4:00 p.m. and the grace period is 5 minutes, employees clocking out 
between 3:55 and 4:00 will have a clock out time of 4:00. If they clock out at 4:54 or earlier, then 
the actual clock out time is used.
Minutes after end of shift  – Specify the grace period after the end of the shift. If employees clock 
out during the grace period, their clock out time is adjusted to the end time of the shift.
If the end of the shift is 4:00 p.m. and the grace period is 5 minutes, employees clocking out 
between 4:00 and 4:05 will have a clock out time of 4:00. If they clock out at 4:06 or later, then the 
actual clock out time is used.
Between Job Lag Time  – Specify the amount of time allowed between jobs. If employees exceed 
the amount of lag time between jobs, the time is charged to an indirect ID.
For example, presume you specify 5 in this field. If an employee clocks out of the first job at 2:00, 
then clocks into the next job at 2:04, then no lag time is charged to an indirect ID. The four 
minutes are posted to the second job. If the employee clocks in to the next job at 2:06, then six 
minutes are charged to an indirect ID. 
Minutes Before/After Breaks  – Specify the grace period before and after breaks. If employees 
clock in during the grace period before a break, their time is adjusted to the start of the break. If 
employees clock out during the grace period after a break, their time is adjusted to the end of the 
break.
5In the Break/Meal Indirect ID field, specify the indirect labor ID to use when a break or lunch 
period is deducted from time posted to the job.

What is Workflow?
9 – 2 | Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide What is Workflow?
Use Workflow to create predefined conditions and rules for guiding users through specific tasks within 
applications, such as Purchase Order Entry and Customer Order Entry. Embedded into the logic of 
VISUAL, Workflow works behind the scenes. When you activate a workflow, all the areas of VISUAL, 
as defined in the workflow, must behave in accordance with the workflow and its set of rules.
Using a workflow-based approach can help you achieve these goals:
• Streamline repeatable processes.
• Define a rule and condition based environment. Because individuals or their knowledge of
processes should not determine process flows.
• Minimize operational errors.
Using the Workflow Designer, you can assign the steps  necessary to complete tasks and define the 
rules  that govern those steps. The Designer saves the workflows you create as templates that 
VISUAL uses to create Workflow IDs.
Common workflows contain: 
• Process Definition
• A graphical representation of the flow of business information
• System of controls, monitors, and management tools to help automate certain aspects of your
business process.
What can Workflow do for you?
• Provide a graphical representation of your processes.
• Graphically create and display the flow of work and tasks.
• Embed business logic into process—in the form of rules.
• Build rules for exception handling.
• Track the status of process steps.
• Involve third party applications to perform tasks.
• Inform users of new tasks or warn them of late tasks.
• Connect to Task Maintenance functionality.
Preliminary Requirements
Before using Workflow, you should be familiar with VISUAL applications, such as Task Maintenance 
and Document Maintenance. You must also know how to add users and create user groups.
Refer to these sections: 
• For information on using Task Maintenance, refer to the “Engineering Change Notices” chapter.
• For information on adding documents in Document Maintenance, refer to the “Document
Maintenance” chapter. 
• For information on setting up groups for tasks and authorizations, refer to the Infor VISUAL
System Administrator’s Guide .
What is Workflow?
Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide | 9 – 3• For information on adding new users, refer to the Infor VISUAL System Administrator’s Guide .
Workflow and Double-byte Characters
Workflow does not support the use of double-byte characters. This includes all aspects of the 
workflow itself, such as rules and properties, and the VISUAL records on which the workflow is run. 
For example, if you set up a workflow to run on parts in Part Maintenance, then all Part IDs must use 
single-byte characters. Otherwise, the workflow will not be triggered. 
Starting Workflow

Building Workflow Templates
Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide | 9 – 17Building Workflow Templates
A workflow template is basically a diagram that organizes a business process into actions and paths, 
with Steps representing actions and Rules  representing paths. For each step and rule you define 
properties, including statements and conditions. The properties of the action determine the tasks to 
be completed. The properties of the path define the path of the flow.
After you create and save a template, you can change the status from inactive to active. When a 
template is active, VISUAL starts a workflow each time a document (for example, a purchase order or 
work order) is saved and meets the conditions specified in the template.
To build a workflow template, refer to these sections:
• Working with Steps
• Working with Rules
• Working with Statements
Working with Steps
9 – 18 | Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide Working with Steps
When working with step properties, you may want to take some time to investigate and think about 
what you want to achieve with the step. Some of the things you may want to consider are:
• What are you attempting to do with this step?
• What conditions do you want met?
• Are there any errors on which you want to halt the process? Do you want to notify the user on
these errors but allow a continuation of the process?
• Are there any documents you want attached to this step of the process?
• Are there any people you want to notify at this step?
• Are there any programs or commands you want to run when the user reaches this step?
Because what happens on one step or rule can effect other steps, you may also want to consider 
what happens on prior and subsequent rules and steps.
Adding Properties to a Step
To add properties to a step:
1Right-click the step to which you are adding properties.
2Select Properties
Note: This read-only information appears in the dialog status section: Status, Started on, Last 
notified, and Completed. For more information on status fields, refer to the “Viewing Status 
Information” section later in this chapter.
3In the Label field, specify a name for the step. You may want to consider using a name indicative 
of what you are attempting to accomplish on this step.
4To re-evaluate the workflow each time a document (for example, a Purchase Order or Purchase 
Requisition) is saved, select a re-evaluation method from the Re-evaluation list. You can select 
one of these options:
Never  – VISUAL never re-evaluates the workflow.
and restart workflow here  – When re-evaluating, VISUAL undoes all previously completed steps 
in the workflow and restarts the workflow at the current step.
This function is necessary if the information in a workflow document (for example, a customer 
order) changes frequently.
and continue where left off  – VISUAL re-starts the workflow from the “start” step and checks the 
properties of each rule and step in the workflow to make sure conditions have not changed since 
the last time the document was saved. If a condition has changed, the workflow proceeds down 
the appropriate path.
When re-evaluating a workflow, VISUAL also checks the evaluation sequence in the Rule 
Properties dialog.
Working with Steps
Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide | 9 – 19For more information on evaluations, refer to the “Working with Evaluations” section later in this 
chapter.
Note:  You must consider all possible conditions or the workflow may not complete the intended 
business process.
5If this is the first step in the workflow, select the Start Workflow Here  check box.
6To evaluate this step periodically, select the Evaluate on Timer  check box. The system evaluates 
the step based on the interval you set in Preference Maintenance. For example, if you specified 
15 in Preferences Maintenance, the system would evaluate the step every 15 minutes.
To set up the interval to use in Preferences Maintenance:
aSelect Admin , Preferences Maintenance .
bIf the Preferences table does not contain a Workflow section and DetectMinutes entry, click 
Insert Row and specify this information:
Section  – Workflow
Entry  – DetectMinutes
Value  – Specify the frequency in minutes with which the system should evaluate the work flow 
step. You can specify a value between 1 and 60.
cClick Save.
Clear the check box to check to see if the step needs to be when the user saves the type of 
document governed by the workflow. 
7In the Notifications section, specify this information:
E-mail Address  – Click the E-mail Address  button and select the address of the person who 
receives an email notification. You can also specify an email address using your keyboard.
E-mail Subject – VISUAL populates the subject line of the notification email with the Workflow ID 
($WrkID) and Step number ($WrkStep). 
For example, Workflow Notification 9030/ Step 3 .
To change the format of the subject line, click in the E-mail Subject field and specify the 
information.
E-mail Body  – Workflow populates the body space of the notification email with this information:
• Workflow Type ($WrkType)
• Workflow Name ($WrkName)
• Workflow ID ($WrkID)
• Workflow Step ($WrkStep)
For example, Workflow $WrkType / $WrkName / $WrkID is at step $WrkStep .
E-mail Attachments  – To attach a document to your email, click the Attachments  button to open 
the Email Attachments dialog where you can select a file.
Note: The VE Programs Link and Documents buttons are reserved for future use.
Execute Command  – To open a program file (for example, an Excel spreadsheet) when the 
notification takes place, click the Execute Command  button and select the action from the dialog. 
Working with Steps
9 – 20 | Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide To open an VISUAL executable and sign in with the user's ID and password, specify this

where program is the name of the executable you would like to open. For example, if you would 
like to open Customer Order Entry, specify this information:
${VE.VMORDENT.EXE}
8You can use workflow rules to identify errors in a process. For example, if you require an 
expiration date on all quotes, you can set up a workflow rule that tests for the existence of an 
expiration date. See "Working with Rules" on page 9–22 in this guide.
Use the VE Program Action area to specify the actions that occur when the rule that is 
immediately before the step is used to identify an error, and the error conditions have been met.

occurs, the user cannot save the document that triggered the error. 
Stop here if error  – If you selected the Return error  check box, select the Stop here if error  
check box to stop the workflow. Clear the Stop here if error check box to continue the workflow. 
Return message  – If you selected the Return error check box, select this check box to display a 
message in the error dialog. Specify the text in the Message field. If you selected the Return 
error  check box, we recommend that you also select the Return message check box and specify 
text. If you do not select the Return message check box, then <null> is displayed in the error

Next Line  – Use the Next Line option to consider one database column in relation to a second 
database column to determine the records to select. For example, to create a statement that 
selects parts with a unit price (part.unit_price) that is greater than or equal to 20% more than the 
wholesale unit cost (part.whsale_unit_cost), you would specify these two lines:
You can combine more than one Next Line statement. For example, to create a statement that 
selects parts with a unit price greater than or equal to 20% of the wholesale unit cost but less than 
or equal to 50% of the wholesale unit cost, you would specify these two lines:

Working with Statements
9 – 28 | Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide Using the Workflow Rule Table
In a typical workflow, you create statements for tables within an application (for example, 
PURCHASE_ORDER for the Purchase Order application). However, some workflows require that 
you create a statement for the condition of a specific rule or step. To allow the creation of rule and 
step statements, Workflow provides non-database tables, such as  Workflow_Rule and 
Workflow_Step. These tables allow you to create statements for status and time conditions. For 
example, you can set a time condition for a step that must be completed by a specific date.
Creating a Workflow Rule/Step Label Statement
A statement containing a Label value affects the current rule. The trigger for the Label value is the 
name of the current rule in the Label field.
For example, the label name of this rule is “PO, $10000.”
To create a Workflow Rule/Statement Label statement:
1If necessary open a Rule Properties dialog.
2Click the Insert  button.
3In the Table column, click the arrow and select either   Workflow_Rule  or Workflow_Step . 
4Click in the Column column, click the arrow and select Label .

the label name of the current rule.
6For more information on completing workflow statements, refer to the “Working with Statements” 
section.
Creating a Workflow Rule/Step Status Statement
A statement containing a Status value affects the current rule. The trigger for Status is the value in the 
Status field. The Status field is read-only and displays “Complete” when VISUAL has completed the 
current rule or “InProcess” when VISUAL has started, but not completed, the current rule.
To create a Workflow_Rule Status statement:
1If necessary open a Rule Properties dialog.
2Click the Insert  button.
3In the Table column, click the arrow and select  either   Workflow_Rule  or Workflow_Step  
4Click in the Column column, click the arrow; then select Status .
5If the statement requires a value in the <Operator> Value or <Comparison> Value column, specify 
one of these values:
InProcess  – The statement requires that the status of the current rule is in process. The 
InProcess  value is case and space sensitive.

What is the Allocation Utility?
10 – 2 | Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide What is the Allocation Utility?
The Allocation Utility performs soft allocations of supply quantities to customer order demand in a 
“batch mode.” Use the Allocation Utility to establish allocations, or “links,” of supply to customer 
orders by part and/or warehouse and decrease the time you would normally spend in Customer Order 
Entry looking for suitable links of supply for customer orders, one line at a time.
Allocation is by site.
Allocation Processing
The Allocation Utility performs allocations in two modes: by part and by warehouse. Allocation by part 
commits supply to demand irrespective of warehouse; allocation by warehouse commits supply to 
demand from the same warehouse.
De-allocation
Before creating new allocations, you can remove existing allocations. Permission to do this, to “de-
allocate,” is controlled first by the REALLOCATE setting on the demand/supply link record.
If REALLOCATE is set to No on the link, the Allocation Utility does not de-allocate the link.
If REALLOCATE is set to Yes on the link record, the Allocation Utility references the customer 
REALLOCATE setting.
This allows a given allocation to be “fixed” by the user, regardless of the customer setting.
During the entering of Customer Types in Accounting Entity Maintenance, you can specify, per type, if 
reallocation is a default setting. In Customer Maintenance, when you select a Customer Type for a 
customer, this default carries over to the customer. You can, however, override this setting by 
selecting or clearing the Reallocate check box as appropriate.
Note: The REALLOCATE function does remove the allocation, but it puts it back, together with any 
new allocations, when the allocation utility is run.  To fully remove an allocation, you must manually 
remove the allocation.
Sequencing
The first step in performing allocations is the proper sequencing of supply and demand. The first 
material available to the Allocation Utility is on-hand inventory. After the inventory has been 
committed, the Allocation Utility sequences future supply orders by due date. Relevant supply order 
types include purchase orders, work orders, work order coproducts, IBTs, and possibly planned 
orders.
What is the Allocation Utility?
Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide | 10 – 3The first set of demand orders the Allocation Utility considers are back orders sequenced by rank and 
due date. It sequences other demand orders by rank (priority) according to customer type and due 
date. The Allocation Utility considers only customer orders as demand.
Behind the Scenes of the Allocation Process
Allocation is done by site. The Allocation utility allocates supply to demand in three passes:
1It attempts to allocate on hand inventory to demand orders in rank (priority), due date order.
If supply is sufficient and committed to all demand orders, allocation is complete. If not, pass 2 
and 3 are still available.
2Allocate on hand inventory to demand in rank, due date order, up to the fill rate on the order.
3Allocate remaining on hand inventory and future supply orders to demand orders in rank, due 
date order until supply runs out.
Orders that received fill rate allocation in pass two are eligible to receive future supply allocation 
in this pass.
The Allocation Utility only considers demand orders that have a ship date within the allocation 
fence.
During allocation by warehouse, the Allocation Utility disregards any orders that do not have 
Warehouse IDs.
Setting Up and Running the Allocation Utility
To set up and run the allocation preferences:
1From the Admin menu, select the Allocation Utilities . option.
2If you are licensed to use multiple sites, click the Site ID  arrow and select the site to use. If you 
are licensed to use a single site, this field is unavailable.
3To allocate for a range of parts, click the appropriate browse button and select the Starting and 
Ending Part IDs to use.
4To allocate for a range of warehouses, click the appropriate browse button and select the Starting 
and Ending Warehouse IDs to use.
Note: By entering only a Starting ID, VISUAL ignores all parts prior to that ID and includes the ID 
and all those after it. By entering only and Ending ID, VISUAL includes all parts up to and 
including the ID, and ignores all parts after it.
5In the Options for allocating inventory section, select these options:
Allocate On-hold Inventory  – To allocate inventory that is currently on-hold, select the Allocate 
On-Hold Inventory  check box. Classify parts as on-hold in Warehouse Maintenance.
What is the Allocation Utility?
10 – 4 | Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide Allocate Unavailable Inventory  – To allocate inventory that is currently unavailable, select the 
Allocate Unavailable Inventory  check box. Classify parts as unavailable in Warehouse 
Maintenance.
Reevaluate Partial Allocations  – To reevaluate those demands to which it has already made 
partial allocations, select the Reevaluate Partial Allocations  check box.
6In the Options for Allocating Future Supply section, select these options:
Allocate Future Supply Orders  – To consider supply orders to be received in the future as it 
allocates supply to customer order demand, select the Allocate Future Supply Orders  check 
box.
Relevant supply order types include purchase orders, work orders, work order coproducts, 
interbranch transfers, and possibly planned orders.
If you select the Allocate Future Supply Orders check box, you can select where to assign the 
allocation:
Allocate Unreleased Orders  – To allocate unreleased work order quantities to customer order 
demand, select the Allocate Unreleased Orders  check box.
Allocate Firmed Orders  – To allocate firmed work order quantities to customer order demand, 
select the Allocate Firmed Orders  check box.
7Click the Run toolbar button.
As the Utility carries out your allocation instructions, a progress dialog box appears.
Note: To stop the allocation before it has finished, click the Cancel  button.
If the allocation session is successful, a message appears.
8Click Ok.
9When you have finished allocating, select Exit from the File menu.
Understanding Allocation
This example illustrates how the Allocation Utility allocates supply to a customer order for which there 
is insufficient stock of on-hand inventory to satisfy demand.
Example scenario:
• There is, at the time of order, a quantity of 383 in Warehouse MMC-MAIN.
• There is a purchase order for 300 of the same parts due in on 1/10/2008.
• There is an unreleased work order for 5,000 due to reach released status on 1/11/2008.
• No quantity of this part is on hold or unavailable in warehouse MMC-MAIN.
You would set up the allocation utility as follows:
By selecting the same Starting and Ending Part IDs, VISUAL will allocate supply only for the part you 
select.
By selecting the same Starting and Ending Warehouse IDs, VISUAL will allocate supplies from within 
that warehouse.
What is the Allocation Utility?
Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide | 10 – 5Because all of the check boxes in the Options for Allocating Inventory section are clear, VISUAL will 
only use available supplies for current demand.
Because all of the check boxes in the Options for Allocating Future Supply sections are selected, 
VISUAL will try to use orders you expect to receive in the future for demand you expect to need in the 
future.
When you run the Allocation Utility, these actions are performed:
On the first pass, the Allocation Utility allocates the 383 parts in inventory in MMC-MAIN to the 
customer order according to the customer’s priority and the due date of the order. Because this is the 
only order for this part, all 383 parts are allocated to this order. The customer’s priority and fill rate 
mean nothing.
On the second pass, nothing occurs because this is the only customer order for this part.
On the third pass, the Allocation utility checks future supply for quantities to allocate to the customer 
order. It looks for the earliest date. In the case of unreleased or firmed work orders, the release date, 
or in the case of purchase orders, the receive date.
Finding the purchase order with a release date of 1/10/2008, it allocates the purchase order quantity 
of 300 to the customer order. Continuing to look, it finds the unreleased work order with a release 
date of 1/11/2008 and an order quantity of 5,000, and allocates the remainder to the customer order.
When you open the customer order after running the Allocation utility, “Multiple Links” appears in the 
Supply Type column indicting that VISUAL obtained supply for this customer order from more than 
one source. In this case, VISUAL obtained supply from inventory, a purchase order, and an 
unreleased work order.
In the Customer Order entry window, highlight the order line and select the Assign Supply to 
Customer Order Line  option from the Edit menu. The Supply Links dialog box appears with the three 
links of supply the Allocation Utility created appearing in the line item table. See“Customer Order 
Entry” on page 7-1 in the Sales guide.

What is Data Interchange?
11 – 2 | Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide What is Data Interchange?
Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) is an optional module that imports and exports data into and out of 
VISUAL. The import and export occurs using VISUAL’s Data Interchange (.VDI) files. There are two 
executables that perform this function. VMDIGEN.exe, the Generate Data Import Layouts window, 
defines the .VDI file layouts. VMDIXCHG.exe, the Data Import Utility Exchange window, performs the 
import or export of data.
If you have the line EDI Menus=Yes (“Y” or “1” also apply)  in Preferences Maintenance, the system 
displays an EDI menu in the main toolbar. You can open all three EDI applications from this menu.
What is EDI?
EDI is the electronic exchange of business documents in a predefined standard format. As a key 
component of Electronic Commerce, EDI controls costs, improves quality, increases efficiency, and 
gains strategic advantage.
The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) sets the standards for EDI in the United States. 
The United Nations standards body, UN/EDIFACT, sets the international standards for EDI. The 
ANSI accredited standards committee, X12, is the U.S. representative to the United Nations 
standards body. The ASC X12 standards specify the format and data content of electronic business 
transactions. Through the use of the standard, all organizations can enjoy the efficiencies of a 
common interchange language.
What is Electronic Commerce?
Electronic commerce is a general term that refers to the use of computer and telecommunications 
technologies to support trading in goods and services. Some technologies such as EDI, electronic 
mail, and electronic funds transfer are already widely used. Some of them (including EDI) require 
agreements between trading partners (buyers and suppliers) in order to govern the electronic trading 
relationship.
Electronic commerce technologies can be used in any environment where documents are exchanged 
between organizations, including procurement/purchasing, finance, trade and transport, health, law 
and revenue/tax collection.
The potential benefits for both suppliers and buyers include reduced paperwork and administrative 
lead times, more timely business transactions, quicker and easier access to information, and reduced 
need to re-key information into computers. These benefits allow agencies to adopt more efficient 
purchasing practices such as Just-In-Time, Quick Response, and Direct Store Delivery.
What is Data Interchange?
Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide | 11 – 3What is Integration?
An ideal extension of EDI-capability is to provide a seamless solution between the EDI translation 
software and another major application that can utilize incoming data and/or produce outgoing data, 
such as VISUAL. The “sharing” of data between applications is called Integration. The obvious benefit 
of integration is the elimination of redundant data entry. Other benefits include the reduction of errors 
due to re-keying, and the reduction of personnel that are necessary for data entry.
The Data Import Utility provides integration capability between VISUAL and your EDI software.
You can directly integrate this information through the Data Import Utility:
• Actual Demand Information (Inbound Customer Orders (CPO))
• Planning or Forecasting Information (Inbound Master Scheduler/Customer Forecast (PLN))
• Actual Cash Receipt information (Inbound Cash Receipts for Invoices (CSH))
• Purchase Receipt Acknowledgement (RCA)
• Outbound Customer Order and Customer Order Change Acknowledgments (ACK)
• Actual Shipment Information (Outbound Advance Ship Notice (ASN))
• Actual Accounts Receivable Information (Outbound Invoices (INV))
• Vendor Purchase Order Information (Outbound Purchase Orders (VPO))
• Warehouse Shipment Advice (WSA)
Integration Requirements
Integration between an EDI translator and VISUAL usually requires the use of integration “maps.” 
Both the translation software and VISUAL often require maps that format the data that is brought into 
or extracted from the database.
There are many commercially available EDI communication software products that will allow you to 
build maps in that software to produce the file formats readable by VISUAL’s data integration module. 
Integration with those products is available from our Professional Services Organization as well as 
from some of our channel partners.
In order to integrate your EDI data with VISUAL, you must determine which fields VMDIXCHG 
populates (inbound data) and from which it extracts (outbound data). To do this, use the the Data 
Import Utility Generate Layouts window to define the file layout and select the fields for each record 
type.
EDI Requirements

Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide | 11 – 5Starting the Generate the Data Import Layouts 
Window
You need to define the .VDI file formats using the Generate Data Import Layouts window before the 
Data Import Utility can support any import or export activity. Because the necessary data in any given 
application depends on the destination or source, the Data Import Utility requires you to indicate 
exactly which data elements it will use. While you are responsible for specifying the elements of each 
table, the Data Import Utility controls the sequence of the elements in the file layout.
To start the Generate Data Import Layouts window:
Select Data Import Generate  from the EDI menu.
Inbound & Outbound Layout Process Overview
Inbound Layout
Once you know the data fields you are importing, use the Generate Data Import window to define a 
.VDI file layout to match the data with the proper VE fields. After you complete this, the Data Import 
Exchange window expects to import a file that matches the layout.
Outbound Layout
Use the EDI implementation guide from your trading partner or sample EDI data to determine which 
data fields you need to extract from your database in order to create the necessary EDI file. Then use 
the Data Import Generate Layouts window to select the fields, design the exported file layout, and 
record definitions. Finally, use the EDI mapping software to translate the data into the EDI software 
for transmission to your trading partner.
Considerations Before Creating Data Imports Layouts
This section contains some basic information about creating Data Import layouts. After this section, 
specific instructions for creating layouts of each type appear.Caution:  The data you are exporting may be sensitive; therefore, you may want to limit 
accessibility to VMDIGEN.exe. Use Security Maintenance to control user access.
Starting the Generate the Data Import Layouts Window
11 – 6 | Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide Accessing Layouts
The Key/Version and Description buttons allow you to select a layout from the list of existing layouts. 
Once you have created and saved a layout, you can access it using either of these buttons.
File Types
Outbound files can have a file type of either Single or Multiple; Inbound files may only have a File 
Type of Single. For this type, the Multiple radio button is unavailable.
Record and File Naming
The Multiple file type writes each record type to a separate file. VISUAL imports and exports Header 
tab fields as records beginning with the letters HDR.; the .VDI file name ends in the letter H. For 
example, ACK0001H.VDI contains the HDR records exported for layout 0001. Header Special Detail 
tab fields are records beginning with the letters SDL; the .VDI file name ends in the letter D. The Line 
Item tab fields are records beginning with the letters LIN; .VDI file name ends in the letter L. The Sub 
Line Item tab fields are records beginning with the letters SUB; .VDI file name ends in the letter S. 
The Additional Line Item tab fields are records beginning with the letters ASL; .VDI file name ends in 
the letter A.
Tab Access
All 5 tabs described above are available to the ASN  and WSA  keys. The ACK , CPO , and VPO  keys 
allow you access to the Header, Line Item, and Sub Line Item tabs. The CSH , INV, and RCA  keys 
allow you access to the Header and Line Item tabs. The PLN key allows you access to the Header 
tab.
File Styles
Fixed File Style
A fixed file indicates that the data in the .VDI file(s) will always occupy the same “fixed” space for each 
field and record. For example, if you have selected the Part ID in the Line Item tab of your VMDIGEN 
layout, and the layout shows the Part ID as being 30 characters long at position 25, then each time 
you export the Part ID for the LIN records of this layout, it will begin at position 25 and will take up 30 
character positions. Typically, the Data Import Exchange module blank fills the unused portion of any 
alphanumeric fields and zero fills the unused portion of any decimal or number fields.
Starting the Generate the Data Import Layouts Window
Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide | 11 – 7Fixed Style and Newline
If you select Fixed as the File Style, you can also choose from the Record drop-down list. For 
example, if you want fields in the records to appear in fixed positions (per layout) and each record to 
appear on its own line, you would choose Fixed as the file type and then Newline from the record 
drop-down list. For Fixed layouts for which you have selected nothing from the record drop-down, 
VISUAL normally imports or exports all records on the same line.
Delimited File Style
If you select Delimited as the style, you also need to select a delimiter for the end of each record, and 
the character VISUAL should use to separate each field in the record. For example, if you have 
selected the Part ID in the Line Item tab of your Delimited VMDIGEN layout, and Newline is your 
record type, Comma your field delimiter, your data would be:
LIN,02001,1,PRODUCT_P,55
LIN,02001,2,PRODUCT_Q,18
Immediately after the last bit of data in the Part ID field would be a comma, followed by the start of the 
next field. At the end of each record, VISUAL starts a new line for the next record. In the example 
above, 02001 is the Customer Order ID, followed by the Line Number, the Part ID, and the Quantity. 
The example uses Newline as the record delimiter, so each LIN record appears on its own line. The 
Delimited style does not blank-fill or zero-fill the unused portion of any exported fields – only the 
actual data is exported (and VISUAL only expects to find the actual data in the VDI file you are 
importing).
Accessibility to Buttons and Boxes
For keys ASN, ACK, INV, RCA, VPO, and WSA the Inbound radio button is unavailable; for keys 
CPO, PLN, and CSH, the Outbound radio button is unavailable.
Several buttons and boxes are accessible to you only for CPO layouts. As a result, those buttons and 
boxes are unavailable for all other layouts. The fields you can use for CPO layouts are the Inbound 
Duplicates Rule button (listed to the right of the fields on the Header tab, these buttons handle the 
Update, Reject and Replace functions); the Delete Unshipped Lines checkbox (listed to the right of 
fields on the Line Item tab); and the Delete Unshipped Schedules checkbox (listed to the right of fields 
on the Sub Line Item tab).
Accessibility to Options Menu Choices
Keys CSH, CPO, and ACK are the only keys for which you can select special settings. For keys ASN, 
INV, PLN, and VPO, the special settings options are unavailable.
The Options menu option Flush Temp. Cash Tables is only available for key CSH.
The Options menu option Print Length Discrepancies is available for all keys.
Starting the Generate the Data Import Layouts Window
11 – 8 | Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide Mandatory Fields
When selecting data fields for any layout key, you may notice that certain fields under each tab are 
selected by default and some are simply unavailable. Fields selected by default are Mandatory fields 
for the key with which you are currently working. Any inbound CPO, PLN, or CSH Data Import layouts 
and .VDI files must contain the Mandatory fields in order to import properly. Also, any outbound ASN, 
ACK, INV, RCA, VPO, and WSA layout automatically exports these Mandatory fields as part of the 
tabs you use in the layout.
Hidden Fields
When selecting data fields for the CPO layout key, you may notice that certain fields under each tab 
are not visible among the Data Import layout fields. VISUAL addresses these fields; they are 
classified as Hidden for the CPO. As a result, you can’t import data to those fields.
The database fields still exist (as you can easily verify – see your System Administrator for more 
information). The only field hidden in the VPO key is the Purc_Line_Del.Del_Sched_Line_No (in the 
Sub Line Item tab). There are no hidden fields for keys ACK, ASN, CSH, INV, or PLN. If interested, 
please see the available Hidden field listing.
Default Layouts
When you start VMDIGEN for the first time, the program creates pre-defined Default layouts for the 
seven available layout keys and assigns each a version number of 0000. You can use these default 
layouts as you would any manually created layout, meaning you can modify or delete them. If you do 
delete a layout, the Data Import Utility recreates the layout automatically the next time you start the 
program. If interested, please see the available Default field layout listings.

4Begin to define a record layout. See the section “Defining Record Layouts” later in this chapter
Creating CPO Layouts in VMDIGEN
If you are licensed to use multiple sites, use caution when defining and using a CPO layout. Since you 
specify the Allocations Require Warehouse/Location setting (DDP) on the accounting entity record, 
some of your entities may require you to specify warehouse IDs/locations in allocations (DDP 
enabled) while others do not. Sites assigned to an accounting entity inherit the accounting entity’s 
setting. As a result, the warehouse ID in all CPO layouts is optional. 
If you plan to use a CPO layout in conjunction with a site that is DDP enabled, you must select a CPO 
layout that contains a Warehouse ID. If you import a .vdi without a warehouse ID to a site that 
requires the warehouse, the file import will fail.
If your site is DDP enabled, all customer order lines in the .vdi file must include the warehouse ID. 
Otherwise, the file import will fail.
If your site is not DDP enabled, you can include a warehouse ID in a CPO layout even though the site 
does not require a warehouse. If a warehouse is specified in the .vdi file, then the warehouse ID will 
be inserted in the customer order line. If a warehouse is not included in the .vdi file, the file import will 
still be successful because the site does not require the warehouse.

5Click the Header  tab and choose the appropriate Inbound Duplicates Rule for headers, line items, 
and delivery schedules.
Note: The Update check box must be selected in the Header Inbound Rule section to use Line 
Item Duplicate and Delivery Schedule Duplicate features.
During the import of data, the Data Import Utility checks the import file records to see if duplicate 
data exists. Duplicate data has the same primary key in the targeted VISUAL table.
For CPO imports, a duplicate customer order has the same Customer Order ID as an order that 
already exists in the database.
If a quantity exists in the SUB record, VISUAL compares the quantity of the first delivery schedule 
to it, and then updates it with the quantity with the difference between the two. If the first delivery 
schedule is less than the fab build qty, and you are using the Fab Build Quantity as your base, 
VISUAL reduces the first delivery schedule qty to 0. If there is no fab build qty at the time of 
import, VISUAL imports the first delivery schedule qty in the VDI file (as if you had chosen to 
import as discrete).

update the customer orders with information from the .VDI file, select the Update Dispatched 
Orders  check box.
10Click the Line Item  tab and select the Delete Unshipped Lines  check box to delete any 
unshipped lines on an order before updating with updated data from a new .VDI file. This feature 
is useful for customers whose trading partners insist that they delete any customer order line 
items not shipped on an order prior to receiving updates for that order.
If you select to Delete Unshipped Lines, this warning message is shown:
“This will delete ALL unshipped lines on matching imported customer order headers regardless of 
which lines are imported. Processing will also delete ALL unshipped delivery schedule lines for 
those customer order lines containing delivery schedules.”
11Click the Sub Line Item  tab and select the Delete Unshipped Schedules  check box to delete 
any unshipped delivery schedules on an order before updating with updated data from a new .VDI 
file. This feature is useful for customers whose trading partner insists that they delete any 
customer order delivery schedule lines not shipped on an order prior to receiving in updates for 
that order.
If you select to Delete Unshipped Schedules, this warning message is shown:
“This will delete ALL unshipped delivery schedule lines of those matching customer order line(s) 
being imported.”
12Click the Line Item  tab and begin to establish Match Fields.
If you have chosen Update (see step 6) as your inbound rule, you can choose how to determine 
line item matches for your CPO layout. If you do not choose any line item match fields, VISUAL 
updates line items based on a match of the Part ID. If you have multiple line items on an order for 
the same Part ID, it will only update the first occurrence of the part. You may need to choose 
additional match fields to avoid that problem.
It is possible to use the line item number as a match field, but many EDI trading partners don’t use 
the line item number in the incoming data. You may need to use other fields to determine the 
correct line item for update.
To solve the problem of matching on the line item number, choose other fields for VISUAL to send 
in the line item. You can choose a combination of fields that allow you to create a unique line item 
in the order. If the combination you have selected does not determine unique line items, you will 
Starting the Generate the Data Import Layouts Window
11 – 14 | Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide need to add more fields to your match criteria until you find the right combination. For example, 
Part ID and EDI Release Number may determine a unique line item for your order. If that’s not 
unique, try adding the Shipto ID field.
Note: If you use the line item number field as part of your match criteria, VISUAL ignores all other 
match fields and the line item number determines the match.
Also, if you have delivery schedules on your line items, do not use the Desired Ship Date field as 
part of your match criteria. VISUAL uses the Desired Ship Dates in all of the delivery schedules 
for the line item and finds the earliest date, and then updates the Desired Ship Date field on the 
line item with that date. If you use delivery schedules, make an effort to avoid using the Desired 
Ship Date field as part of your match criteria.
If you are not using delivery schedules, the Desired Ship Date is fine to use as part of your match 
criteria.
In the Available Match Fields data field, highlight the field to add.
Click the Right  Arrow to move the field into the Selected Match Fields section date field.
Repeat this procedure for each line.

14Select the appropriate options:
Select the Auto Generate CO ID  check box to generate the Customer Order ID for you. After 
selecting this check box, you must enter a Prefix Token for use in your VDI file.
During the exchange of EDI data, VISUAL replaces the token with the actual generated Customer 
Order ID.
With the Autogenerate CO ID check box selected, VISUAL generates unique Customer Order IDs 
for incoming EDI customer orders. You cannot, however, use this feature if order details may 
change, because VISUAL has no way of matching the original order with the incoming changes to 
the order. Use this feature for unique, discrete customer orders that you are sure will not change.

more information.
Defining Record Layouts
On the bottom half of the Generate Data Import Layouts window there are five tabs: Header Tables, 
Header Special Details, Line Item Tables, Sub Line Item Tables, and Adt Line Item Tables.
Each tab represents a record type in the layout. Not all tabs are used in each layout. If a tab or record 
type is not relevant to a key type, no tables appear when you select the tab.
Each tab also displays a list of default tables that contain the most appropriate fields for the selected 
key. Usually, all of the fields you want to access are available by default. If not, you can “join” 
additional tables to the ones displayed.
1Select a tab to start defining a record layout.
2Click the Data  button to select data elements for the record type you are defining. (There is a 
Data  button below each list of tables.)
The dialog box shows all of the available columns of the tables for that record type. The table 
displays the table name (or view), the column or field name, the data type, the position in the .VDI 
file record, the length of the field, the scale (number of decimal places) and whether the inbound 
data may be null for this column.
Starting the Generate the Data Import Layouts Window
11 – 20 | Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide 3Select Print , View, File , or E-mail  and then click the Print  button to print, view, or send the data 
elements you have selected thus far. For more information on sending reports, refer to the 
“Concepts and Common Features” chapter.
Because this information is taken directly from the database catalog, the data fields must already 
be defined in the schema. If you intend to import user-defined columns and/or tables, these 
columns and tables must be added to the database prior to using the Generate Data Import 
Layouts window.
See “Joining Tables” for more information
When you first define a new layout, the default tables appear. These tables are mandatory. You 
can remove the columns from a layout, but the table itself is not removable.
If one or more data elements that you require is not displayed in the default tables, you can add 
the tables that store those fields to the end of an existing table list. Any user-defined or custom 
tables should have primary keys defined so that the join process can find the primary key 
automatically.
If you join additional tables to a tab, the mandatory tables appear first in the table lists, followed by 
each table you added. The columns appear alphabetically within each table.
4To include a column as part of the .VDI layout, highlight the appropriate column and click on the 
Select  button.
The x in the row header disappears and the position of the data element in the record appears in 
the Pos column. This position is only accurate if the File Style of the layout is Fixed; VISUAL 
updates the position any time you select or deselect an element.
The sequence in which the columns appear in the table window is the same sequence they will 
appear in the .VDI file layouts for each record. This sequence is critical because the .VDI file(s) 
will be created or read by an external application, most likely an EDI mapping tool. The use of an 
external application needs to be designed around the .VDI layout.
5Once you define the record layouts for each tab, click Ok.
You return to the Generate Data Import Layouts window.
6Click Save.
The Data Import Utility import and export data is placed in files having predefined names. The only 
user-defined portion of the file-naming is the directory in which they reside. Thus, when importing or 
exporting is done, the program always looks for or creates the same files in a user-defined place.
To keep multiple versions of the files (i.e., archive each imported or exported file) then you must do 
this outside of the Data Import mechanism.
.VDI files are named for their layout key target and layout version.
For multiple files format, there may be up to five files, for each tab used in the Generate Layout 
window. Each file has a suffix indicating its contents:
ASN9999 H.VDIHeader (HDR) records
ASN9999 D.VDIHeader Special Detail (SDL) records
ASN9999 L.VDILine Item (LIN) records
ASN9999 S.VDISubline records (SUB) records
Starting the Generate the Data Import Layouts Window
Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide | 11 – 21ASN9999 A.VDIAdditional Line Item records (ASL) records
Note: 9999 is the layout version.
Single file formats:
XXX9999.VDIContains HDR and LIN records
Note: XXX is the layout key and 9999 is the layout version.
Joining Tables
If you require additional tables, you can add them to the end of the item list in the appropriate tab. Any 
user-defined or custom tables should have primary keys defined so that the join process can find the 
primary key automatically.
VISUAL sets up joins automatically for mandatory tables, but does not permit access to the join for a 
mandatory table. You must define the joins for any non-mandatory tables that you add.
To join tables:
1First select the tab to which to add the tables. From the table selection drop down box, select the 
table to join, then click on the Join button.
The Join Clause dialog box appears.
You can only join a table that is relative to the one that already exists.
You must always select RECTYPE. It is fixed depending on the tab your are in (HDR, SDL, LIN, 
SUB, ASL)
2Select one of the primary key columns on the right table, then select the corresponding data 
element on the left column.
For example, if the Part table is on the right, and its Primary Key, ID, is selected, you should find a 
column containing the Part ID on the left, such as CUST_ORDER_LINE.PART_ID.
3Click on the appropriate number button to number the column, then click Set .
The join clause must include all the fields that make up the primary key.
4Click Ok.
The table is now joined.
The user-defined table is an advanced feature of the Data Import Utility. In most cases, you will 
not need this feature.
Please be careful when selecting the join keys. An incorrect join can cause data inconsistencies 
in your .VDI files.
Starting the Generate the Data Import Layouts Window
11 – 22 | Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide Associating Customers to Outbound Layouts
You need to associate each outbound layout with one or more VISUAL Customer IDs so that when 
you run the layout through exchange, it knows whose data (invoices, ship notices) to export. To do 
this:
1If you haven’t done so already, save your outbound layout by clicking on Save.
2Select Associate  from the File menu or click the Associate  button on the main toolbar.
The Associate Outbound Format dialog box appears.
3Select which customers will use this layout when exporting data.
You can click on the Select All  button to select all of the customers listed and the Unselect All  
button to deselect all of the customers you have selected.
4Click on Save , and the click Close .
The customers you selected are now associated with this layout. When this layout is selected in 
the Data Import Exchange window, data for all customers who have been associated with this 
layout will be exported.
Printing Length Discrepancies
Use the print length discrepancies function to print a report of the fields that have changed beginning 
with version 6.2x. Rather than the Data Import Utility automatically changing the lengths, you can 
choose to keep the older field lengths. This may help you keep some of your older EDI maps 
functionally accurate.
1From the Options menu, select Print Length Discrepancies  or click the Print Length 
Discrepancies  button on the main toolbar.
2Select an output for the length discrepancies report:
Print  - VISUAL prints the report after you select standard print options.
View  - VISUAL displays the report on your screen before printing.
File - VISUAL presents you with a Print To File dialog box in which you can specify where to place 
the report.
E-mail  - Select this option to send the report in a Rich Text Format (.RTF) through electronic mail. 
When you generate the report the system attaches the file to a Microsoft Outlook email. For more 
information on addressing and sending the email, refer to your Microsoft Outlook user 
documentation.
3Click Print  to output the report to tone of the above four destinations.
4Click Apply to DB  to apply field changes to the layout.

Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide | 11 – 23Flushing Temporary Cash Tables
For layout key CSH, you have the option of flushing temporary cash tables. You may be using maps 
to receive cash receipts, which the Data Import Utility uses to populate temporary cash tables. Unless 
you flush them out, those temporary cash tables remain in the database. Allowing those tables to 
remain may result in inconsistent performance and unexpected error messages. It’s a good idea to 
flush your temporary cash tables from time to time.
1From the Options menu, select Flush Temporary Cash Tables  or click the Flush Temporary 
Cash Tables button on the main toolbar
A dialog box appears, asking you if you are sure.
2Click Yes to continue.

Starting the Data Import Exchange Window
11 – 24 | Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide Starting the Data Import Exchange Window
The Data Import Exchange window is the application that does the actual importing or exporting of 
data. Data Import Exchange imports/exports the data to and from the .VDI files.
To start the Data Import Exchange window:
Select VMDI Exchange  from the EDI menu.
Importing and Exporting Data In the Data Import Exchange 
Window
Use the Data Import Exchange window to import or export data to and from the VISUAL database.
If VISUAL encounters closed or cancelled orders during the import process, the import utility adds the 
order using the next available number and notifies you that it found a duplicate. You can view the 
details of the transaction by viewing the log.
1In the Key/Version fields, specify which key (ACK, ASN, CPO, CSH, INV, PLN, RCA, VPO, or 
WSA) and layout version number to use (defined using VMDIGEN.EXE).
When you specify the key and version, VISUAL selects the appropriate radio button from the 
Direction section. The data is either incoming or outgoing. VISUAL also determines the file type, 
the inbound or outbound rule, and the file style for the data (previously defined using 
VMDIGEN.EXE).
Note: If you select CPO, you can optionally select the Close Partial Shipped Schedules , and 
Include Today in Proration check boxes. You cannot manually override the Delete Unshipped 
Lines or Delete Unshipped Schedules  options using VMDIXCHG.EXE. You must make 
changes using VMDIGEN.EXE.
If you do not want to delete lines shipped at zero quantity, add SuppressZeroLine to the 
[Shipping] section of Preference Maintenance and specify a value of N.
If you select PLN, you can optionally change the Include Today in Proration option.
2In the Directory field, specify the target directory for the .VDI file.
For an inbound file, this is the location in which VISUAL will find the .VDI file; for an outbound file, 
this is the location in which VISUAL will create the .VDI file(s). VISUAL exchanges each key and 
version separately.
VISUAL updates the run date for the selected .VDI layout after each exchange; it appears in the 
Run Date field. Normally, data is only exported once. The Data Import Exchange window only 
exports data (A/R Invoices and ASN’s) with a date equal to or later than the Run date of the .VDI 
layout. You can enter an earlier date/time stamp to re-export data, but use caution. Using an 
earlier run date will resend all data again from the specified date and later, which could mean 
resending duplicates.
3Click on the Exchange  button on the main toolbar or select Exchange  from the File menu.
Starting the Data Import Exchange Window
Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide | 11 – 25If there are any critical errors while VISUAL is importing data, a message box that describes the 
error appears. VISUAL also generates a log file that contains more information about critical 
errors and information about less critical errors.
The log file lists each record that has an error and the error message; and shows each column 
with the data that VMDIXCHG was trying to write. The log file is located in the same user 
specified directory and has the same name as the .VDI file with a .log extension.
You should check the log file after each exchange.
Examining Log Files After Importing and Exporting
Four different logs are generated by VMDIXCHG for various keys.
Error Logs
This log is generated when importing CPO, CSH, and PLN documents and is very useful when 
debugging initial import problems. This log will only contain errors (CPO documents rejected due to 
match criteria will not appear in this log). The log is named for the key and layout (for example, the 
error log for CPO layout 0001 would be called CPO0001.log). The log is overwritten each time this 
layout is run.

4Enter the number for the next session log. VISUAL automatically increments the number as you 
conduct exchanges. To use a different number, enter it in the data field.
Enter a suffix if you want the exchange log file to have a special ending. For example, a next 
session log of 6 and a suffix or VE, produces a log file (Key)6VM.log.
5Select the prefix KEY  check box to attach the Key/Version (one of seven) of the exchange to the 
front of the log file.
Selecting this makes the Prefix data field unavailable. For example, setting preferences to a next 
session log of 7, a suffix of VE, and a KEY of ACK, leads to VISUAL producing the log 
ACK7VM.log.
Running the Data Interchange Utility in Command Line 
Mode
There are two modes of operation for VMDIXCHG: Standard and Command Line mode. Standard 
mode requires input from the user; Command line mode does not. If VMDIXCHG finds a valid 
command line, it executes in command line mode. Command line mode allows you to specify the run 
options currently available through the main screen.
When you run the program in command line mode, you use a cumulative log file, VMDIXCHG.LOG. 
Each time you execute the program, VMDIXCHG appends time stamped status information to the 
end of the file.
The VMDIXCHG.LOG file resides in the same directory as all other *.VDI and *.LOG files. When you 
run the program in batch mode, you can exchange multiple types of data (i.e. PLN, VPO, etc.) in the 
same run.
VMDIXCHG.APP
Command Line:
The command line must conform to the this format:
The first value is always the EXE name, VMDIXCHG.
The next three values are the database connection strings. The data base connection strings follow 
standard VISUAL format:
-D <database name>
Starting the Data Import Exchange Window
11 – 34 | Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide -U <User ID>
-P <password>
All command line arguments up to this point are mandatory. The remaining arguments are optional. If 
you do not specify a particular argument, VMDIXCHG applies a default value where applicable.
Exchange File Path:
-F <file path>
If you omit the –F argument, VMDIXCHG uses the file path specified in the DataFilePath row in the 
EDI EXCHANGE section of Preferences Maintenance. You should only use the –F option if you need 
to temporarily override the default directory path.
Next, list the types of values to exchange. You may list more than one type. Keep in mind that you 
must separate additional values with a space.
The valid types are:
• ACK
• ASN
• CPO
• CSH
• INV
• PLN
• RCA
• VPO
• WSA
You must specify at least one valid data type, each of which must have a 4 digit unique identifier after 
it. The data type / numeric identifier combination equates to the KEY and VERSION columns of the 
VMDI_LAYOUT table.
Inbound Rule:
VMDIGEN establishes the inbound rule. You cannot change it from within VMDIXCHG. Therefore, 
you must specify inbound types by their KEY/VERSION (i.e. CPO8888).
Note: Inbound rule parameters are only applicable for inbound types such as CPO, CSH, and PLN.
Outbound Rule:
The next argument specifies whether you want VMDIXCHG to either append the outbound data to 
existing output files, or create a new file each time. Specify –A to append the file, or -O to overlay the 
file. If you omit this argument, the default is set to overlay the file.
Note: Outbound rule parameters are only applicable for outbound types such as ACK, ASN, INV, 
RCA, VPO, and WSA.
This example illustrates a command line that executes VMDIXCHG connected to database 
VMFGDEMO as user MIKE and password OCEAN, and executes the exchanges for CPO0000, 
INV9999 and ASN3333. VMDIXCHG overrides the EDI file directory for this run with 
C:\Infor\EDI\TEMP. In addition, the INV output file is overlaid and the ASN output file is appended 
onto it.

Because the program is running without user intervention, you cannot change the run date 
parameter. The run “as of date” for each data type that you are exchanging is from the 
LAST_RUN_DATE column of the VMDI_LAYOUT table for each layout key.

Integration Requirements
This section relates to the integration of EDI data into and out of the VISUAL database. For Harbinger 
and Sterling Commerce, you may choose to have Infor Global Solutions design and create your 
integration maps or you may choose to develop your own maps. For other EDI translators, you need 
to develop any necessary “maps” to and from that software in the format that the Data Interchange 
module produces and reads.
These sections describe the modules and EDI transactions that can currently be integrated. 
Additional EDI transactions are handled directly through the EDI translation software in standalone 
mode.
Customer Order Information (Inbound)
This is typically the most complex transaction to integrate because of the vast differences in how you 
and your trading partners may use the transaction data.
You need to consider several factors:
• Which inbound transaction(s) contain customer order information? (850, 860, 830, 862, etc.)
• Is the trading partner’s VISUAL Customer ID present in the EDI data?
• Is there a Ship to location that applies to the entire order or does each line item have a separate
Ship to location?
• Are the VISUAL part numbers present in the EDI data?
• Do you want to accept the pricing as it comes in should VISUAL override it?
Starting the Data Import Exchange Window
11 – 36 | Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide EDI Transaction 850 - Purchase Order
The purchase order is the most widely used commercial EDI transaction. While the information 
contained in a purchase order may vary in content and format from company to company, there are 
pieces of information that are common to every PO:
• Order number and date
• Buyer’s Company ID
• Ship-to location
• Requested delivery date
• One of more line items containing quantity ordered, unit of measure, unit price, and a part number
or description
Other transactions may contain customer order information, such as the PO Change (860) or Material 
Release (830). This information can also be brought into VISUAL through integration.
Planning Information (Inbound)
This is typically the simplest transaction to implement. When planning information is imported, the 
CUSTOMER_ FORECAST table is populated in VISUAL database. These records contain a 
CUSTOMER ID, FORECAST ID, FORECAST DATE, PART NUMBER, and QUANTITY.
EDI Transaction 830 - Planning Schedule
The planning schedule is most typically used to transfer forecasting/material release information. You 
can use this transaction in a variety of ways, such as:
• a simple forecast
• a forecast with the buyer’s authorization for the seller to commit to resources, such as labor or
material
• an order release mechanism, containing such elements as resource authorizations, period-to-
date cumulative quantities, and specific ship/delivery patterns. The order release forecast may
also contain all data related to purchase orders, eliminating the need for discrete generation of
purchase orders.
For inbound planning and customer order information, successful integration often depends on 
having raw EDI data (sample or production) from the trading partner. This data is necessary in order 
to determine the absolute segment and element location of each required piece of data.
The EDI requirements or “mappings” that a trading partner are sometimes inaccurate or outdated. 
Because the integration maps are dependent on the format of the data, changes or discrepancies 
may cause implementation delays. This is why sample data is so critical to a smooth and timely 
integration process. Accurate data not only eliminates the need for modifications to the maps, but is 
also essential for testing the maps prior to delivery to the customer.

Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide | 11 – 37Shipping Information (Outbound)
Shipping data is extracted from VISUAL to one or more fixed length files. The files contain the BOL 
information, the order or packlist information, and the line item information for each order. The details 
of each file are determined by the requirements of your trading partner.
EDI Transaction 856 - Advance Shipment Notice
The ship notice lists the contents of a shipment and its configuration within the shipment container at 
various levels of detail. ASN’s are used extensively in the retail and automotive industries, where 
Just-In-Time (JIT) and Efficient Consumer Response (ECR) are an integral part of the management 
philosophy.
A typical ASN has this information:
• ASN number and date
• Shipment identification number (SID)
• Date and time of the shipment
• Bill of lading (BOL) number
• Number of packages
• Total shipment weight
• Product number and quantity of each item shipped (SKU)
Invoice Information (Outbound)
Invoice data is extracted from VISUAL to one or more fixed length files. The files contain the Invoice 
header information, the line item information, and (when applicable) subline item information. The 
details of each file are determined by the requirements of your trading partner.
EDI Transaction 810 - Invoice
The invoice is the second most widely used EDI transaction set. It is a natural extension of the 
purchase order and can generally be implemented at the same time. In most cases, an invoice simply 
repeats much of the information contained in the purchase order, while adding invoice related 
information such as:
• Invoice number and date
• Quantity shipped and invoiced amount for each item
• Total invoice amount
• Payment terms

Tips for Successful Importing and Exporting
Use these tips and hints when importing or exporting EDI information.
Customer Orders (CPO)
The EDI Release Flag, located under the EDI tab in the Customer Order Entry window, is key to the 
successful export of invoices (INV) and Advance Ship Notices (ASN). You can activate the flag using 
several methods:
You can manually mark the flag on the customer order at some point prior to exporting the ASN or 
INV.
You can use Customer Maintenance (under the E-Commerce tab) to specify the customer as an EDI 
Trading Partner. Doing this ensures that all future orders will have the EDI flag selected.
Starting the Data Import Exchange Window
Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide | 11 – 45You can establish your CPO import file so the EDI Release Flag field is “Y” for all incoming orders.
Advance Ship Notices (ASN)
Before you can export ship notices using the Data Import Utility, the EDI Release Flag must be set for 
customer orders. The EDI Release check box is located in the EDI tab of the Customer Order Entry 
window. You can select the check box any time prior to exporting data using VMDIXCHG. After you 
have entered the customer orders in VISUAL, ship them using Shipping Entry.
After Shipping the customer order and creating packlists, select Print Bill of Lading from the 
Shipping Entry File menu to create a BOL. Saving the Bill of Lading prompts VISUAL to generate a 
BOL number. At this point, you can launch an ASN layout in VMDIXCHG for this customer and you 
should be able to successfully export the ASN document. Failure to either mark the customer order’s 
EDI Release flag in Customer Order Entry or create a BOL in Shipping Entry, prevents the ASN 
documents from exporting.
Note: VMDIXCHG ignores any shipping notices you may create from orders that don’t have the EDI 
Release flag set. You can set the flag after you have shipped the orders and VMDIXCHG will then 
examine the documents runtime, assuming the date/time and Association requirements are also 
correct.
For example, if you are sending out Ship Notices to Able Manufacturing, VMDIXCHG searches for 
documents with a Customer ID of ABLMAN, the EDI Release Flag set, have a BOL, and meet the 
date/time requirement.
Launch VMDIXCHG for the proper layout (for example, ASN0012 for Able Manufacturing 856 
documents) and verify the date on which to start exporting data. For example, if today is 5/12/99 and 
you enter 5/10/99 on the Run Date line, then VMDIXCHG will export all valid documents from 5/10 
through today. Valid documents are those that have the EDI Release Flag set on them and for which 
you have created BOLs.
Invoices (INV)
Before you can export ship notices using the Data Import Utility, the EDI Release Flag must be set for 
customer orders. The EDI Release checkbox is located in the EDI tab of the Customer Order Entry 
window. You can select the checkbox any time prior to exporting data using VMDIXCHG. After you 
have entered the customer orders in VISUAL, ship them using Shipping Entry, and invoice them 
using the Invoice Forms option available from the Reports menu. At this point, the orders have been 
entered, shipped, and invoiced in VISUAL. Now you need to export the invoices using VMDIXCHG.
Note: VMDIXCHG ignores any shipping notices you may create from orders that don’t have the EDI 
Release flag set. You can set the flag after you have shipped the orders and VMDIXCHG will then 
examine the documents runtime, assuming the date/time and Association requirements are also 
correct.
For example, if you are sending out Invoices to Able Manufacturing, VMDIXCHG searches for 
documents with a Customer ID of ABLMAN with the EDI Release Flag set, that you have shipped 
using Shipping Entry, invoiced using Invoice Forms, and meet the date/time requirement (see below).
Starting the Data Import Exchange Window
11 – 46 | Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide Launch VMDIXCHG for the proper layout (for example, INV0012 for Able Manufacturing 810 
documents) and verify the date on which to start exporting data. For example, if today is 5/12/02 and 
you enter 5/10/02 on the Run Date line, then VMDIXCHG will export all valid documents from 5/10 
through today. Valid documents are those that have the EDI Release Flag set on them, and you have 
shipped using Shipping Entry, and invoiced using Invoice Forms.
Forecasts (PLN)
Follow this procedure to transfer customer forecast (planned data) information that you have imported 
from an EDI 830 transaction to the Master Production Schedule as a part forecast.
1From the main menu, select Tools , then Material Planning Window .
The Material Planning Window appears.
2From the File menu, select Master Production Schedule .
3Click Customer Forecasts .
The Transfer Customer Forecasts to Part Forecasts dialog box appears.
4Select the Import to Both  option button.
5Enter a Forecast ID and select the Purge prior data  and Bucketless import  check boxes.
Results appear in the Master Production Schedule. Enter the Part ID to view.
6To edit the forecast, either make revisions to the Master Production Schedule or click the Edit 
Customer Forecasts  button at the bottom of the dialog box and do the editing there.
For more information on customer forecasts, refer to the “Material Planning Window” chapter.
Special Notes
If you import an EDI 830 document into VISUAL as a customer forecast, VISUAL Quality  only imports 
the 8 fields on the Customer Forecast screen.
The Customer Forecasts screen shows the 8 fields VISUAL Quality  imports. They are :
Part ID or Customer Part IDCustomer ID
Forecast IDRequired Date (s)
Required Quantity(s)PO Reference
Forecast DateWarehouse ID
For example, you can create the Forecast ID in the EDI map to be a combination of PO# and Shipto 
DUNS # (N104). The only two EDI segments VISUAL examines when creating a customer forecast 
are the LIN and FST.
One approach that works well involves making the Forecast ID the same as the Part ID. By using the 
Part ID as the Forecast ID, anytime a date or quantity changes for that part, VISUAL updates the 
forecast rather than adding to it. The only time VISUAL adds to the forecast is when the trading 
Starting the Data Import Exchange Window
Infor VISUAL System-wide Features Guide | 11 – 47partner for that part sends a new date. In this map example, the customer originally wanted to use a 
combination of the EDI 830 Run Date and the Customer ID. However, if the trading partner had 
changed quantities for previously received dates, they would not send the same run date again. The 
run date is essentially the date the trading partner sent the EDI 830. Therefore, the entire forecast for 
that part - and all of the dates included in it - would be inserted into the Customer Forecast table. As a 
result, each time they sent an 830, VISUAL adds it.
One disadvantage of using the Part ID as the Forecast ID is that if the client decides to use reject 
duplicates (with the Forecast ID set up as above), then anytime you received another line item for the 
same part and Customer ID, VISUAL would reject the line’s data.
When you run VMDIXCHG on a PLN VDI file, VISUAL enters the data into the Customer_Forecast 
table. In order to view the forecast data from the Edit Customer Forecasts screen you must first 
Transfer Customer Forecasts to Part Forecasts. To do that, select the Import to Both option button 
(to import the customer forecast to the forecast and master schedule tables), select the Purge Prior 
and the Bucket-less Import check boxes, enter a Forecast ID (appears on the Master Schedule 
screen), enter EDI-FORECASTS, and click Begin .
The Forecast ID displaying on the Master Schedule you imported using the Transfer feature (above) 
is not the same Forecast ID you imported using the Data Import Utility (shows on the Customer 
Forecast screen). For example, the Forecast ID you entered on the transfer screen is EDI-
FORECASTS, but the actual forecast IDs imported from the Customer_Forecast table might be 
named EDITESTPO1, EDITESTPO2, and EDITESTPO3.
Purging Prior: A Few Hints
Choose the same ID every time you perform a transfer (EDI-FORECASTS, for example). When you 
perform the transfer, VISUAL updates the new Customer_Forecast data. For example, if the qty for 5/
1/02 for forecast ID EDITESTPO1 is 104 and it is actually 50 in the new data, VISUAL changes it to 
50 when you perform the transfer and the master schedule will change to show the proper amounts. If 
you entered a new Forecast ID (EDI-FORECASTS2, for example) when running the transfer, then 
VISUAL imports all the contents of the customer_forecast table to the master schedule table. 
Essentially, the same data would appear twice in the master schedule (once for the EDI-
FORECASTS and once for EDI-FORECASTS2).
Adding a Trading Partner Name to an ASN (EDI 856)
The Trading Partner ID MUST be in the First Record of the First data file (BOL table of HDR ). To do 
that, follow the steps below.Caution:  If you do not perform these steps in the order listed, your joins may be inaccurate 
and VISUAL could consequently export incorrect data. For example, when 
performing joins in the Additional Line Item file of an ASN, you could mistakenly 
export data for ALL packlists in the system if you perform the steps out of order or 
miss some.
