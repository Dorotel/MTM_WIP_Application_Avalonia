Plant Information: (MAP! Label Fig 1)  
Presses, emergency exits, PPE stations and egress lanes are clearly marked on the included map. Press 
numbering follows the order presses were installed, and appear as "100 -XX". They are often referred to 
by simply the last two digits (ie: "press 11"). See Fig 1  
A more detailed (and larger) map is posted in the receiving office, showing where different dunnage 
types and different customers’ products should be located. This is not a hard rule, as we will sometimes 
run out of room in a designated area (or have to use an area from something different).                                                                                          
Lift Specifics  
Inspection Checklist ( EDIT TO REFLECT NEW LIFTS W/COMPUTERIZED CHECKLIST)  - every lift will have a 
clipboard with an inspection checklist on it. These should be filled out for every shift that lift is used. If 
multiple people are using the same lift in the same shift, only the first person needs to fill the checklist 
out. If you  are using more than one lift, make sure that the checklist is filled out on each! Checklists are 
collected and replaced on Sunday night.                                                                                             
Lifts with electronic login  – To “turn o n” 
1. Switch ON the keypad by holding the red button on the right side of the keypad .  
2. Use fob to login to keypad uni t  
3. If starting the first time this shift, do the inspection –  some items are after turning on .  
4. Put on  seatbel t  
5. To turn on, press and hold the green start button .  
6. The forklift should be ready to g o  
 
To “turn of f” 
1. Press the red stop button on the keypa d  
2. Press logout on F 2  
3. Yes  
4. If the truck will sit for a while also shutdow n  
These lifts also have a collision sensor: if it detects a collision, the lift will shut down. You will need to 
find a supervisor to restart the lift, who will also document any damages . 
 
Safe driving -  safe drivin g is a must. Be aware of your surroundings at all times, and extremely mindful of 
distracted workers.  
You are expected to sound your horn when approaching intersections or workers, or when passing 
behind another lift. This helps others be aware of your pre sence, and cuts down on accidents.

 You will also find "stop" signs on the floor at several intersections. You must bring your forklift to a 
complete stop at these locations, as they are in areas with high foot traffic and no visibility.  
Keep your speed down (5 mph), and your load as low as possible. Given space constraints, it is 
sometimes necessary to be moving with a load elevated in the air (such as taking a die to the die shop): 
be extremely careful in these situations, and cut your speed to a crawl.                   
Accident Procedure  - if an accident should occur, inform the shift foreman immediately! If there is 
damage to plant property (ie: you hit a rack), docum ent it for maintenance.                              
 
Capacity by lift -  every lift has it's max capacity listed on it's information tag. However, as a simple cheat, 
here's a quick breakdown of the capacities for each (listed by asset number):  
- Yellow lift (979 -10): 25" -  4400 lbs  
- Crown standup (979 -14): 24" - 2450 lbs  
- Receiving Nissan (979 -16): 24" -  6575 lbs  
- Titan (979 -20): 24" -  8165 lbs  
- Die shop Cat standup (979 -21): 24" - 4700 lb s 
- Pressroom Nissan (979 -22): 24" -  4700 lbs  
- Pressroom Cat standup (979 -23):  
- Yellow Doosan electrics (979 -24, 979- 25): 24" - 4400 lbs  
- Aislemaster (979 -26): 24" -  4400 lbs                
- Large Toyota (979 -27) -  
- Small Toyota (979 -28) -  
- Shippi ng Nissan Electric (979 -29) -      
- Orange Doosans (979 -32, 979- 33, 979 -34) -

  Work Orders:                             
Almost all of the information you need can be found on the work order. See fig 2  for a sample. The part 
number is highlighted in yellow, the die location in green, coil number in blue, and the scrap type in red.

 You may also find special instructions (such as packaging) in some work orders. If you are unfamiliar 
with a job, make sure to look over the work order for any information that you need.

 Computer  
Clocking In  - the clock  in procedure is simple. Enter your four digit employee number, press "enter". 
Then press 4 (for "indirect"), type "MH -INT", and press "enter" again.  Clocking out, enter your employee 
number again, then press 7 (for "clock out").                                                                                                            
 
Wait List ( see fig 3 ) - the pressroom material handlers run on the waitlist: press operators post what 
they need, where, and how soon. Postings are handled in order: do NOT mark a task completed until it 
is. When taking care of a task, hit the edit button (listed under "actions", it looks like a pen), and enter 
your initials in the field marked "carrier".

 Visual  - the system we use here at MTM is called "Visual". When you first get on your lift, open Visual 
and log in (IT will give you a login and password). Go to the "Inventory" menu, and select "Inventory  
Transaction Entry": this is the window you will use most  often.  
 - Original Inventory  (see fig 4 ): this is what you will use when taking completed parts from the presses. 
Enter the work order number (WO -012345), press "tab", enter 1 (batch is always 1), tab to quantity. 
Every work order will autofill the locati on: make sure that the listed location is where you are putting 
the parts, or that you tab to location and enter the location you put them. Remember to hit "Save" after 
entering the data.

If a press is running component parts that are going straight to the next operation, they still need to be 
inventoried! The location used is "WC" (work center).     
You may get an error message when you hit save,  that reads "Work order closed". If this happens, click 
proceed and make note of part numbe r, work order, location, and quantity. Inform the material planner 
of this information.

 Transfers (see fig 5 ): you will use this procedure when transferring parts or material from one location 
to another. Go to the "edit" menu in your inventory window, and select "Transfer Inventory between 
locations". Enter the part number, tab to quantity. Now on your screen, press the small button next to 
"from" ([...]): this will bring up a list of every location that part has ever been located. Press the "search" 
button, tab to "quantity" and enter "<>0": this will filter out empty locations. Double click on the 
location you are pulling from, tab to enter the location you are taking the parts or material to (plant 
number is always "002").

You may get an error message reading "part not assigned to location XX. Assign?".   Hit enter, then hit 
enter again.

 This same procedure is used to move parts from a location to the work center (WC), or to NCM. If 
moving parts to NCM, remember that they need  an NCM tag ( see fig 6 ), and a note should be left for the 
material planner to change them to "unavailable". Make sure any tags are with the product (this means 
both receiving and vendor tags for coils), and that the NCM tag is completely filled out. NCM c oils also 
need a sample, and example bad part.

If finished product is located in the WIP aisle (usually due to a lack of space), it still needs to be 
inventoried and located. Any such parts taken from WIP to a press should be transferred accordingly.                           
Auto issue locations -  Som e parts are kept in locations that they auto -issue from. These do not need to 
be transferred out, as the system will automatically withdraw the required amount when the press 
operator reports their parts in. These locations and parts are:  
W-00:  04-29515 -000, 04 -29198- 000, 04 -29244 -000, 04 -27802 -000

If you bring parts that auto issue from a different l ocation (ie: bringing a crate of  32 090 12s 
from location U -B2-20), transfer them from where you’re taking them to their auto issue 
location (NOT to WC).  
                                                                                      
Product Handling  
You will see two basic tag types: "Finished Goods" and "Work in Progress". How you handle each is 
different. Never take a crate or pallet from a press without a tag on it!  
- Finished Goods : this means pretty much what it says, the part is complete. Some of the parts we make 
go straight to the Finished Goods aisle, some get inventoried. To differentiate between them, check the 
production schedule screen: finished goods will have an [FG] on their entry.  
  Any parts being put into inventory 
need to be marked with your initials in 
the r ecta ngular box on the tag ( see Fig 
7). Use a black marker for this (pen 
lines aren't as visible)

 - Work in Progress : these are parts that have further steps to go. They come in three forms: basic WIP 
(which gets taken to the WIP aisle, fig 7A ), washer (next process 89, and goes to the washer  area, fig 7B), 
and Outside Services (marked in the lower right of the tag with OUTSIDE SE, and goes to the outside 
services area, across from the production office, fig 7C ). Regardless of which type it is, DO NOT 
INVENTORY WIP PARTS

 Partial Tags  – On some orders, you may end up with a partial crate or pallet. These need to be 
inventoried as normal, but shipping will put a blue tag on it ( Fig 8 ), with instructions for handling the 
next time the job is run. When you see one of these tags at a press , all you need to do is to transfer the 
quantity on the original tag from WC to FG.

Wrapper  - Some parts will need to be wrapped before going to shipping. Procedure is simple: center the 
pallet on the turntable, press the "film advance" button and pull out a length of wrapping film, hook film 
to the product, and press "Start". You shouldn't be adjusting any of the settings on the wrapper.                                                                                     
 
Banders - Some parts need to be banded for shipping. We use 2 types of banders: nylon and steel.   

 
11 | Page                             Material Handler Training 
Handbook  
 With the nylon bander, you simply wrap a length of banding around the product, and clip the bander to 
the banding. Press the rectangular b utton to tighten, then the round button to seal and cut the banding. 
The bander will beep once complete.  
For the steel bander, we use metal clips. Feed the banding through the clip, then wrap the banding 
around the product. Feed the free end back through t he clip, and bend the banding. Now, use the 
ratchet to tighten, then crimp the clip. Cut the banding with a tin snips.                                                                                                                        
 
Dunnage  
Common Use Crates - we have several crate types used throughout the plant. The most common are 
Kohler crates (large and small), pressboard crates, wire baskets, MTM crates (large and small), MTM 
totes, and gaylords. Refer to the work order to see what type of crate is needed (and what substitutions 
are allowed). If you are unsure (or the work order doesn't specify), check with the shift foreman.                                                                                            
Customer Supplied Crat es & Pallets - several of our customers supply crates or pallets of their 
specification for packing their parts. These include Weber and Briggs crates, Orion pallets, and several 
others. Again, refer to the work order to see what is needed. One note: unles s absolutely necessary, do 
NOT use customer supplied crates or pallets for a different customer's order.                                                                 
Pallet Sizes/Color Coding - pallets are color coded by a stripe at the corners to denot e size. The colors 
and corresponding sizes are as follows:  
40 x 48: Blue  
42 x 48: Red  
47 x 52 (Orion): Black  
55 x 42: Brown  
74 x 40: Yellow  
48 x 48: Orange  
50 x 48 (5 runner): Green  
78 x 44: Grey  
85 x 40: White                                                                                 
Speciality Packing - some parts will require specialty packing materials. These can be found listed on the 
work order, and will mostly be found in the top racks in R bay.  Refer to the map on your lift for help 
finding wha t you need.

Handbook  
 Scrap  
Types : you will be dealing with several types of scrap. The most common are steel, aluminum, and 
galvanized: These are denoted on the work order: steel is listed as either "CRS" or "HRS" (hot rolled steel 
or cold rolled steel). Aluminum is listed as such (we run mostly 3003 or 5052), and galvanized has several 
designations (galvanized, aluminized, galvaneal, etc). There should be a magnet visible on the press to 
tell you what scrap you have. If unsure, check the work order.  
The luggers for  scrap are located in cold storage (through door 6a). 3003 aluminum  goes in the lugger to 
the left as you enter the scrap area, galvanized to the right, 5052 aluminum second to the right 
(accessed by going out through door 6, and back in through door 7), a nd steel  to the far right (accessed 
via door 9a). Should a lugger fill, we do have an  overflow lugger outside ( near the trash dumpsters ). DO 
NOT MIX SCRAP TYPES                  
There are four other types of scrap: "special", wood, rubber and die shop. Woo d is self explanatory. 
Special consists of any material other than the 4 listed, and is put into gaylords for loading on a scrap 
truck. Rubber is taken out via door 11, and dumped into the trash dumpsters. Die shop is dumped into 
small dumpster s out back, accessed through doors 6a and 6.         
We are also responsible for the banding hoppers. These are treated as galvanized, and are located in  
various parts of the plant, and are labeled as “STEEL BANDING ONLY”.  
Scrap Trailers : there are two scrap trailers  on the docks. One is for wood, one is for special material. In 
both cases, neatness counts : try to make sure that you 
are placing pallet stacks or gaylords in neatly, to 
maximize space.          
When loading the metal scrap trailer, you must fill out 
the packing list ( see fig 9). This is located on a clipboard 
by the dock. It lists weight, scrap type (check work 
order), container, your initials, and the date. As always, 
be neat!  
Once the trailer is full, photocopy the BoL. The copy gets 
stapled to the last  gaylord on the trailer, the original 
goes on the material lead ’s desk.  
                                                                                     Fig 9 
 
Dump Bins : most scrap goes into dump bins at the press. 
These are the blue  bins located behind press 14.  

 
13 | Page                             Material Handler Training 
Handbook  
  When a call comes for scrap removal, the procedure is simple. Pick up the bin with your lift, and take it 
to the scrap area. Hook the safety chain to your back stop, unlatch the safety lock (if present), lift the bin 
up to the lugger, and tilt it forward. Now lift the latch handle: the bucket of the bin should tip the scrap 
into the lugger. If the weight distribution is off, you may need to use a prybar to tip it  (or radio for a 
partner to come and use their lift). Reverse the procedure, and take the now empty bin back to the 
press.  
If a lugger is full, use the overflow lu gger , or set the hopper aside and grab an empty . There is  a set of 
magnets to denote what scr ap type by door 6 : remember to swap the magnet to let others know what's 
in there!                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Cardboard: cardboard is placed into the blue recycling dump bins, and is taken out door 12 to be put 
into the baler. You will need the key to the baler (located on a hook next to door 12).  
Procedure is to turn on the baler with the key, then pull the large button: this retracts the ram. Once the 
ram is fully retracted, begin hand loading the cardboard into the hopper. Once the hopper is full, pull 
the switch again to activate the ram. Repeat until the dump bin is empty. When  the last hopper full is 
being crushed, push the switch when the ram is closed (this keeps things drier in wet conditions, and 
prevents other things from getting in). Do not just dump the cardboard into the hopper like it's a load of 
scrap: this will jam u p the baler, and someone else will have to come out and fix it. For your own safety, 
do not climb into the hopper area.                                                                                                             
            
 
Coils  
Locating : you locate coils using the same procedure as outlined under transfers. Open the "transfer 
inventory between locations" window, and enter the coil number (this will usually be either 
"MMC0000123" or "MMCCS00123"), and hit tab. Now hit the small bu tton next to "From" ([...]): this will 
show you every location that coil has been stored in. Click the "search" button, tab to "quantity", and 
enter "<>0" to filter out empty areas.  
Coils  for some jobs  have an added identifier: their heat code. You will fi nd this on the supplier tag, listed 
as "heat/process" or "Lot/Heat". You always want to use up all of one heat code before bringing a 
different one to a press. Make sure to inform the press operator when you change heat numbers.

Handbook  
 Transfer : once you have located  the coil, remember to transfer it in the system. Enter the quantity on 
the transfer screen, double click the location you are taking it fro m, and enter "002" and "WC" for where 
it's going (that denotes the work center). Do this before you take the coil to the press. Remember to 
make sure you have both tags with the coil ( Receiving tag, fig 10A and vendor tag, fig 10 B)

Failing to transfer a coil in the system causes the single biggest headache for your fellow material 
handlers, as they will end up stuck looking for coils that have already been used (and thus wasting time) 
or even having to pull  a job due to lack of coil.

Handbook  
 Many of our coils are stored flat, and therefor need to be flipped upright. We use two methods:  
 
Coil tipper: the coil tipper is the first method: it is just a hydraulic tool that  flips a coil 90*. Pay attention 
to the size of the coil (width and diameter): any coil that is too thin and/or too large can cause problems 
(and even damage the tipper). Maximum capacity  for the coil tipper is 20,000  lbs. 
Procedure is very straight forward: place the coil on the tray. Cut any banding holding the coil to it's 
pallet, and place the restraining bars . Turn on the power, and flip the switch to “Up”. Once the tipper 
stops movin g, flip the restraining bars out of the way and pick the coil with your lift. To repalletize, 
simply reverse the procedure.  If the coil is small, or there’s only one on the pallet, stack more pallets 
under it on the tipper, to bring it out further.  
  I the re are multiple coils on the pallet, take them all to the press. This keeps the tipper free for the next 
person.                                                           
 
Hoist : the second method of tipping a coil is to use one of the hoists. Presses 1, 3, 6, 8 and 18 all have 
overhead hoists in place already (and the press operators will deal with lifting the coils themselves).  
If another press' coil needs the use of a hoist (tipper is down, coil is too narrow or too big), procedure is 
easy. Place the coil under the hoist. Cut any banding that is holding the coil to the pallet. Slip the chain 
or strap through the center of the coil, and between the coil and the pallet (you may need to slightly lift 
the coil with your forklift). Slip the ends of the chain or strap through the hook of the hoist, and raise the 
hoist.  Make sure to stand away from the coil’s direction of travel to avoid injury!  Once the coil is upright 
and lowered almost to the ground , make sure it is "aimed" properly (it should feed over to the left). 
Now set it down to pick up with your lift. One note: some coils are too narrow to stand on their own, 
and will need to be "picked" from the chain.     
*If using this method, remember to place scrap rubber b etween the coil and the strap or  chain. T his is 
both to protect the coil  from damage, and the strap (if using a nylon strap).*  
If you have multiple coils on one pallet, the tags go with the first coil used. Please remember to write the 
coil number on the rest of the coils on that skid for identif ication purposes.                                                                                                                   
Loading : loading the coils into the cradle at the press is fairly self- explanatory. You just place the coil on 
the cradle (m ake sure it's aimed correctly), and place it's tags on the clipboard (throw away the old 
tags).  
One thing to keep in mind is very narrow coils: these will need upright supports put in place, to keep the 
coil from falling over. With the back uprights in place, drive forward with the coil raised high enough

Handbook  
 that you can see the cradle. Go slow, and stop once you see the coil bump the uprights. P ark your lift, 
and place the front uprights: now you can slowly lower the coil onto the cradle.                                                                                                                 
Returns : If a job is completed without finishing the coil out, the remainder will need to be returned to 
inventory. To do this, remove the coil from the cradle (don 't forget to grab the tags), and head back to 
receiving. Place the coil on the scale to get the weight, and open up the inventory transfer window. 
Transfer from WC to whatever location you are putting the coil into.  
You will also have to print a new tag. T o do this, go to the receiving computer and open the Label Matrix 
program, located in the taskbar at the bottom of the screen. Now go to the bar at the top of the screen, 
and hit the "print" button, followed by "ok". This brings up the window for entering tag information. 
Enter everything as it appears on the old receiving tag, changing the quantity and date, and press enter. 
Close that window, and hit "no" when asked if you would like to change counters and keyboard inputs. 
Then minimize the LM window (fai lure to do this can result in the printer spitting o ut blank tags until it 
runs out). Now attach the new tag to the coil, along with the small manufacturer's tag, and put the coil 
away                  
Remember when returning a coil to update the coil board in the receiving office. Write the coil number 
under "cleans", and erase it from the press list.  
 Flat stock (MMF0000XXX) can present a different issue: you can’t always fit it on the scale. You can 
check the supplier tag for the original weight and pie ce count, and divide the weight by the pieces to get 
the weight of each individual piece (then multiply by however many pieces). Sometimes, you may have a 
partial piece: for those instances, there’s a handy equation to figure out the weight:  
Thickness X W idth X Length X Density   
Densities are as follows: Steel (including galvanized), .284; Aluminum, .098; Copper (and brass), .324  
Once you have the total weight, continue as above for coil returns.  
Cleans : this refers to verifying the amount of a coil left, and it's locations. From the transfer screen, you 
print the list of locations for a given coil, and physically check to see if the coil is there, and in the listed 
amounts. Bring a calculator with you. Note any discrepancy, and leave the sheet on the desk of the 
material planner for correction in the system  
If you notice while doing a return or clean that the work center is negative, this means that coils have 
been brought to the press without transferring. Go verify the amounts by location, and transfer wh at 
has been moved.

 Dies  
Locating : die location should be listed on the work order. If it is not, you can look it up on your 
computer.  
Go to the V isual window. Click "Inventory", and select "Material Planning Window". Here, you can enter 
the part number, then hit tab: this will bring up all the info for that part. Now select the "Info" drop 
menu, go down to "Subordinate Parts", and click on "Use Engineering Master": a smaller window will 
open, showing the die (FGT0123 -01) and coil (MMC0000123). Double click on the die: the third column 
of entries, second entry down, will give you the location ( see fig 1 1)       
 
                              Fig 1 1 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Transport : always be extra careful when transporting dies, as they can be easy to damage. Keep your 
speed to a crawl, an d be sure to keep  checking the sides so you aren't clipping anything.                                                                                                               
Placement : whoever is doing the actual setup should be present to help guide you in. Make sur e before 
putting a die in a press, the bottom surfaces have been wiped off to remove any slugs. Do not place a 
die on a pressbed that hasn't been wiped down, and lower the die into place slowly.                                                                                                            
Die Shop : dies go into and out of the die shop on a regular basis. If you need to bring a die to the die 
shop while in the middle of a job, remember to bring the work order with.  
If pulling a die out of the die  shop to put away, and it has a work order on it, take the work order to your 
shift foreman

 Return: to minimize headaches for your partners, do y our best to return dies to their designated 
location. If a die you are pulling doesn't have a location, place it in the area designated for homeless dies 
(currently by the production office ) and leave a note on the material lead's desk.                                                                                                                
 
Trucks  
Dock plate & lock : every dock in the plant is equiped with a dockplate and lock. Do not enter a trailer 
with a lift without the dockplate in place, and the trailer either locked or the wheels chocked.  
 We have two types of deck plates: most are lighter duty, and are operated with a chain pull. Simply pull 
up the chain, and the plate will raise (and extend). Step on it to lower it into place. The three docks i n 
receiving have heavier duty deckplates, and are operated by pressing a button to raise them via 
hydraulics. Press and hold the button until the extension comes out, then release to lower.  
 Both retract in a similar manner. With the hydraulics, press and hold the button to raise the plate: as it 
lowers, the extension will retract. For the others, pull the chain to raise the plate, push down on the 
edge to drop the extension, then step on the plate again to lower.  
 The locks are simple push -button operation . Press one button to lock, the other to release. The light will 
change from red to green when locked.  
 Sometimes, usually due to the trailer being misaligned, the lock won't function properly: instead of 
getting a green light, you will have both lights flashing. If that happens, hit all three buttons at once.  For 
this reason, you want to make sure that the trailer is locked before the driver leaves: if we have a 
misaligned trailer, there's nothing we can do about it until the next driver arrives (which was tes a lot of 
time)  
Generac : one of our biggest customers is Generac, and responsibility for loading and unloading their 
trucks is on the pressroom material handlers.  
- Loading procedure: this is simple, but pay attention to detail!

Handbook  
   - Paperwork : every truck going out will have a clipboard with that load's paperwork and labels, located 
on a hook by the U bay docks. Trucks currently go to one of two different plants: Jefferson and 
Whitewater. Verify that the paperwork in your hand is for the correct truck . 
The cover sheet is your bible ( see fig 1 2): verify that all the numbers match before loading (mistakes can 
happen). Also double check the count of the shipping labels (there should be two for every crate and 
pallet, plus the master label for each part nu mber on that load). Place two shipping labels on each crate 
or pallet, usually on the product label. The master label goes on the last crate or pallet of each part type 
you load, and the shipping list on the very last crate or pallet loaded. Once the load is complete, fill out 
the paperwork: write in the  trailer number under vehicle I D, and initial in the bottom right corner. You 
will do this on three different pages.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
      Fig 1 2 
 
   
 
 
 
 You may have to send a truck short. On first shift, verify with the office before doing this. On off shifts, 
go by the scheduled release time: whatever we have by that point is what gets sent. If that happens, 
modify the paperwork by crossing out the tota l count on that part's sheet, and writing in the actual 
total, then initial the change. This will be done in three places: our copy, the customer copy, and the 
shipping list. Also correct the total count for the truck.  
   - Loading: this is simple and straightforward. Load by part number, three crates to a stack, up to 
twenty -two stacks total (If there are no pallets). All stacks should by three high until the end of the load. 
Do not stack pallets.  

 
20 | Page                             Material Handler Training 
Handbook  
    Whitewater trucks are loaded crates first, then pallets (817s, then 819s). Jefferson trucks are 
somewhat reversed: pallets first (again, 817s then 819s), then crates.  
   Once the load is finished, check for empty screw protector totes or barrels: these need to be sent back 
(totes to Whitewater, barrels to Jefferson). Now retract the deck plate, close the door, unlock the trailer 
and hang up the completed paperwork.  
   Dunnage: every load taken is swapped with another trailer: these will usually have return dunnage. 
This comes in a few different types: lids, base s (standard and short), pallets, screw protectors, and "not 
ours".  
      - Lids and bases: these are basically the same plastic piece for both. The only difference is that bases 
have plywood sides, folded down for easier storage. They come from Generac mix ed: when offloading, 
you have to separate them before putting them away. Lids go in one stack, standard bases in another, 
and short bases in a third. Short bases are only used for 825s. All these items are stored in U- 03 
      If (and it has happened) we r un out of either lids or bases, they can be swapped: you can remove the 
plywood from a base to make a lid, or grab some of the extra plywood we have to turn a lid into a base.  
      - Pallets: these are mostly  in two sizes (blue and/or red). verify what s izes are on the load, and put 
them away in the appropriate stacks.  
      - Screw protectors: there should be at least one tote of screw protectors on every dunnage truck. 
Screw protectors in totes from Whitewater go to roof structures, the ones in barrels from Jefferson go 
to 817s. Always make sure empty to tes or barrels are sent back to the correct plant!  
      - "Not ours": this is fairly self- explanatory. Sometimes, the material handlers at Generac load another 
company's dunnage mixed in with ours. If yo u encounter anything that you don't recognize, set it aside: 
it will be sent back on the next truck with room for it.
