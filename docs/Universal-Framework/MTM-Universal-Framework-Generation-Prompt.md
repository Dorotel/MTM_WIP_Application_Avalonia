# MTM Universal Framework Generation - Complete Application Foundation

## 🎯 **Primary Prompt: MTM Universal Framework (Cross-Platform Avalonia + Windows/Android)**

Create a comprehensive, production-ready universal framework extracted from the MTM WIP Application Avalonia codebase that can serve as a foundation for building new enterprise applications across multiple platforms. This framework should include all reusable components, patterns, documentation, and GitHub Copilot integration, with specific support for Avalonia cross-platform development targeting Windows desktop and Android mobile.

### **🏗️ Framework Structure Overview**

The generated framework should be organized into clearly segregated folders for easy extraction and implementation:

```treeview
