## ðŸ“‹ Recommendations

- Review and fix broken links listed in the detailed report
- Consider using relative paths for internal documentation references
- Verify file paths are correct after any documentation restructuring
- High number of broken links detected - consider comprehensive link audit
- Run link validation regularly as part of documentation maintenance
- Update this validator if new link patterns are introduced

## Validation Details

This report was generated by the MTM Documentation Link Validator, which scans:
- All markdown files in `.github/` directory
- All markdown files in `docs/` directory
- Internal links only (external HTTP/HTTPS links are not validated)
- Relative and absolute paths within the repository

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Broken Links**: Address any broken links listed above
2. **Regular Validation**: Run this validator after documentation changes
3. **Automation**: Consider integrating into CI/CD pipeline for automatic validation
4. **Maintenance**: Update link patterns as documentation structure evolves
