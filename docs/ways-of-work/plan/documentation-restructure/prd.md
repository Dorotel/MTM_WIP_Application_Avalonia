## Goal

### Problem
The current MTM WIP Application has documentation scattered across multiple directories (`/docs`, `/Documentation`, root level files) with inconsistent naming conventions, outdated content, and poor GitHub Copilot integration. This creates:
- Difficulty finding relevant documentation
- Inconsistent developer experience
- Outdated information leading to development inefficiencies
- Poor GitHub Copilot prompt and instruction organization
- Lack of centralized documentation governance

### Solution
Implement a comprehensive documentation restructure that consolidates all GitHub Copilot-related and general documentation into a well-organized `.github` folder structure with:
- Standardized naming conventions (`{Type}_{Name}` format)
- Logical categorical hierarchy (Category/SubCategory/SubSubCategory)
- Complete documentation recreation based on current application state
- Master documentation index for discoverability
- Automated audit system to prevent data loss

### Impact
- **Developer Productivity**: 40% reduction in time to find relevant documentation
- **Code Quality**: Improved consistency through better GitHub Copilot instruction organization
- **Maintainability**: Centralized documentation governance reduces maintenance overhead
- **Onboarding**: New developers can find all resources in predictable locations

## User Personas

### Primary Users
1. **Senior .NET Developer** - Lead developer maintaining the MTM application
2. **GitHub Copilot Power User** - Developer heavily relying on AI-assisted coding
3. **New Team Members** - Developers onboarding to the project

### Secondary Users
1. **Product Managers** - Reviewing feature documentation and requirements
2. **QA Engineers** - Accessing testing documentation and procedures
3. **DevOps Engineers** - Managing CI/CD and deployment documentation

## User Stories

### Core Restructure Stories
- **As a Senior .NET Developer**, I want to find all documentation in a predictable `.github` structure so that I can quickly locate any project information.
- **As a GitHub Copilot Power User**, I want all prompts and instructions organized by category so that I can efficiently leverage AI assistance.
- **As a New Team Member**, I want a master documentation index so that I can understand what documentation is available and where to find it.

### Quality Assurance Stories
- **As a Developer**, I want all recreated documentation to reflect the current application state so that I'm not misled by outdated information.
- **As a Project Maintainer**, I want an audit system to ensure no documentation is lost during restructure so that historical knowledge is preserved.

### Archive and Cleanup Stories
- **As a Repository Maintainer**, I want old documentation archived in a zip file so that I can maintain clean repository structure while preserving history.
