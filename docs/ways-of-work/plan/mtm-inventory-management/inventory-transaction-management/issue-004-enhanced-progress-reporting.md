## Feature Title
Enhance progress reporting with detailed step information

## Parent Epic
MTM Inventory Management Epic - Inventory Transaction Management

## Feature Priority
High - Should Have

## Feature Category
ViewModels & Business Logic

## User Story
**As a** production operator  
**I want** to see detailed progress information during inventory operations  
**So that** I understand what the system is doing and can identify any issues

**Example:**
As an operator saving an inventory transaction, I want to see "Validating data... 25%", "Connecting to database... 50%", "Saving inventory... 75%", "Complete! 100%" so that I know the system is working and can troubleshoot if it gets stuck.

## Functional Requirements

**Primary Functions:**
1. The system SHALL display step-by-step progress during save operations
2. The system SHALL show progress percentages for each operation phase
3. The system SHALL display current operation status (Validating, Connecting, Saving, etc.)
4. The system SHALL provide estimated time remaining for longer operations
5. The system SHALL maintain progress visibility for minimum 2 seconds on success

**Secondary Functions:**
- Cancellation support for long-running operations
- Error state identification with recovery suggestions
- Progress persistence across UI interactions
- Detailed logging of progress steps for troubleshooting

## Technical Implementation Approach

**Components Involved:**
- ViewModels: Enhanced InventoryTabViewModel with detailed progress tracking
- Services: Enhanced ApplicationStateService for step-by-step progress
- Views: Progress display integration in InventoryTabView
- Models: ProgressStep model for structured progress information

**Key Patterns:**
- ApplicationStateService with detailed step tracking and timing
- Progress reporting with percentage, message, and step identification
- Async/await patterns with progress cancellation tokens
- Centralized progress state management

**Data Flow:**
Operation Start → Progress Step 1 → Update UI → Progress Step 2 → Update UI → ... → Complete/Error → Display Result → Auto-clear

## UI/UX Requirements

**Visual Design:**
- Progress bar with percentage display (0-100%)
- Status text showing current operation ("Validating inventory data...")
- Step indicator showing current step and total steps (Step 2 of 5)
- Success state with green checkmark and "Complete!" message
- Error state with red X and descriptive error message

**Interaction Patterns:**
- Progress overlay that doesn't block view but prevents new operations
- Cancel button for long-running operations (where applicable)
- Success state visible for minimum 2 seconds before auto-clear
- Click-to-dismiss for error states after user acknowledgment

**Responsive Behavior:**
- Progress display works in all window sizes
- Text truncation for very long status messages
- Accessible progress reporting for screen readers

## Acceptance Criteria

**User Interface:**
- [ ] Progress bar shows accurate percentage completion (0-100%)
- [ ] Status text describes current operation clearly
- [ ] Step indicator shows current step and total (e.g., "Step 2 of 4")
- [ ] Success state displays with checkmark for minimum 2 seconds
- [ ] Error states display with descriptive messages and recovery actions

**Functionality:**
- [ ] Progress updates in real-time during save operations
- [ ] Percentage calculations are accurate for each operation phase
- [ ] Long operations (>5 seconds) show estimated time remaining
- [ ] Progress state persists across UI interactions during operation
- [ ] Cancellation works for operations that support it

**Technical:**
- [ ] Uses existing ApplicationStateService with enhanced step tracking
- [ ] Progress reporting doesn't impact operation performance significantly
- [ ] Proper cleanup of progress state on operation completion/error
- [ ] Thread-safe progress updates from background operations
- [ ] Comprehensive logging of progress steps for debugging

## Components Affected

**Modified Components:**
- ViewModels/MainForm/InventoryTabViewModel.cs (detailed progress tracking)
- Services/ApplicationStateService.cs (step-by-step progress support)
- Views/MainForm/Panels/InventoryTabView.axaml (progress display enhancement)
- ViewModels/Shared/BaseViewModel.cs (if progress patterns need base support)

**New Components:**
- Models/ProgressStep.cs (structured progress information)
- Services/ProgressTrackingService.cs (if centralized tracking needed)

**Dependencies:**
- Existing ApplicationStateService progress infrastructure
- CancellationToken support for async operations
- Timer services for time estimation and auto-clear functionality

## Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests:**
- Progress calculation accuracy for each operation phase
- ProgressStep model validation and state transitions
- ApplicationStateService enhanced progress methods
- Cancellation token handling and cleanup

**Integration Tests:**
- End-to-end progress reporting during actual save operations
- Progress state persistence across UI interactions
- Performance impact measurement of enhanced progress reporting
- Error state handling and recovery workflow

**Manual Tests:**
- User experience validation of progress feedback
- Visual verification of progress percentages and timing
- Cancellation behavior testing for long operations
- Accessibility testing for progress announcements

## Estimated Effort
S (3-5 days)

## Dependencies & Blockers

**Prerequisites:**
- Current ApplicationStateService progress implementation understanding
- Identification of all operation steps that need progress reporting
- UX review of progress display design

**Blockers:**
- None identified - builds on existing progress infrastructure

## Feature Readiness Checklist

- [x] Requirements are clear and testable
- [x] Technical approach is feasible
- [x] UI/UX design follows MTM patterns
- [x] Dependencies are identified
- [x] Testing strategy is defined

## Additional Notes

This enhancement addresses current progress reporting that is basic and provides insufficient feedback to users. The PRD F5 requirement specifies "Real-Time Progress and Error Reporting" with detailed status messages and progress indication.

**Current State:**
- Basic progress reporting exists via ApplicationStateService
- Simple percentage and message display
- Limited step visibility and user feedback

**Enhanced State:**
- Detailed step-by-step progress with clear descriptions
- Accurate percentage calculations per operation phase
- Time estimation for longer operations
- Improved error state handling and recovery guidance

**Progress Steps for Save Operation:**
1. Validating inventory data... (10%)
2. Connecting to database... (25%) 
3. Checking master data... (40%)
4. Saving inventory item... (60%)
5. Updating session history... (80%)
6. Finalizing transaction... (90%)
7. Complete! (100%)

- PRD: `docs/ways-of-work/plan/mtm-inventory-management/inventory-transaction-management/prd.md` (F5 requirement)
- Current ApplicationStateService implementation
- Existing progress display patterns in MainView
