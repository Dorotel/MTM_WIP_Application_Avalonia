## Feature Title
Add barcode scanning support for Part ID entry

## Parent Epic
MTM Inventory Management Epic - Inventory Transaction Management

## Feature Priority
Medium - Could Have

## Feature Category
Services & Infrastructure

## User Story
**As a** production operator  
**I want** to scan barcodes for Part IDs  
**So that** I can quickly and accurately enter part information without manual typing

**Example:**
As a warehouse operator processing incoming inventory, I want to scan the barcode on each part label so that I can ensure 100% accuracy in part identification and reduce data entry time from 30 seconds to 3 seconds per item.

## Functional Requirements

**Primary Functions:**
1. The system SHALL detect barcode scanner input in Part ID field
2. The system SHALL auto-populate Part ID when valid barcode detected
3. The system SHALL validate scanned Part ID against master data
4. The system SHALL provide visual feedback for successful/failed scans
5. The system SHALL support common barcode formats (Code128, QR, etc.)

**Secondary Functions:**
- Configurable barcode input detection (timing-based or prefix/suffix)
- Audio feedback for successful scans (configurable)
- Barcode format validation and error reporting
- Integration with existing TextBox + SuggestionOverlay workflow

## Technical Implementation Approach

**Components Involved:**
- Services: New BarcodeService.cs for input detection and processing
- ViewModels: Enhanced InventoryTabViewModel with barcode handling
- Views: Visual feedback integration in InventoryTabView.axaml
- Configuration: Barcode scanner settings and format configuration

**Key Patterns:**
- Input detection service monitoring Part ID TextBox
- Event-driven architecture for barcode scan events
- Validation integration with existing master data patterns
- Visual feedback using existing error/success styling patterns

**Data Flow:**
Barcode Scanner → Input Detection → Format Validation → Part ID Population → Master Data Validation → Visual Feedback → User Continuation

## UI/UX Requirements

**Visual Design:**
- Scan success indicator (green checkmark icon with brief animation)
- Scan failure indicator (red X icon with error message)
- Scanning mode indicator (barcode icon in Part ID field when active)
- Status messages integrated with existing error message display

**Interaction Patterns:**
- Automatic focus to Part ID field when scan detected
- Brief visual confirmation (500ms) before allowing next input
- Maintains existing TextBox + SuggestionOverlay functionality as fallback
- Keyboard input still supported alongside scanning

**Responsive Behavior:**
- Works in both full-screen and windowed modes
- Visual feedback visible at all supported resolutions
- No interference with existing keyboard navigation

## Acceptance Criteria

**User Interface:**
- [ ] Visual scanning indicator appears in Part ID field during scan detection
- [ ] Success/failure feedback displays for each scan attempt
- [ ] Status messages integrate with existing error display system
- [ ] Barcode icon indicator shows when scanning mode is active

**Functionality:**
- [ ] Barcode scanner input detected in Part ID TextBox
- [ ] Valid barcodes auto-populate and validate Part ID against master data
- [ ] Invalid barcodes show appropriate error messages
- [ ] Scanned Part IDs trigger same validation as manual entry
- [ ] Manual typing remains fully functional alongside scanning

**Technical:**
- [ ] Configurable scan detection (timing, prefixes, formats)
- [ ] Support for Code128, Code39, QR codes at minimum
- [ ] Integration with existing validation and error handling
- [ ] Performance impact minimal on normal typing operations
- [ ] Proper cleanup and disposal of barcode detection resources

## Components Affected

**New Components:**
- Services/BarcodeService.cs (barcode detection and processing)
- Models/BarcodeConfiguration.cs (scanner settings)
- Configuration: Barcode scanner settings in appsettings.json

**Modified Components:**
- Views/MainForm/Panels/InventoryTabView.axaml (visual feedback)
- Views/MainForm/Panels/InventoryTabView.axaml.cs (barcode event handling)
- ViewModels/MainForm/InventoryTabViewModel.cs (barcode integration)
- Services/ConfigurationService.cs (barcode configuration)

**Dependencies:**
- Barcode detection library (ZXing.NET or similar)
- Existing TextBox + SuggestionOverlay infrastructure
- Configuration system for scanner settings
- Timer services for input detection timing

## Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests:**
- BarcodeService input detection logic
- Barcode format validation
- Integration with existing validation system
- Configuration loading and parsing

**Integration Tests:**
- End-to-end barcode scanning workflow
- Barcode scanner hardware integration
- Performance impact on normal typing operations
- Error handling for malformed barcodes

**Manual Tests:**
- Physical barcode scanner testing with various formats
- User experience validation with actual hardware
- Performance testing with high-frequency scanning
- Fallback behavior when scanner unavailable

## Estimated Effort
M (1-2 weeks)

## Dependencies & Blockers

**Prerequisites:**
- Barcode scanning hardware available for testing
- Barcode format standards defined for MTM parts
- Decision on barcode detection method (timing vs. prefix/suffix)

**Blockers:**
- Hardware availability for development and testing
- Integration complexity with existing TextBox behavior
- Performance requirements for real-time input detection

## Feature Readiness Checklist

- [x] Requirements are clear and testable
- [ ] Technical approach is feasible (pending hardware validation)
- [x] UI/UX design follows MTM patterns
- [x] Dependencies are identified
- [x] Testing strategy is defined

## Additional Notes

This feature addresses the PRD Phase 3 requirement for "Barcode scanning integration for Part IDs." The implementation should be non-intrusive to existing manual entry workflows and provide clear value for high-volume operations.

**Technical Considerations:**
- USB HID barcode scanners typically send input as keyboard events
- Detection can be based on input timing (very fast character entry) or configurable prefix/suffix characters
- Consider industrial scanner requirements (IP ratings, durability)
- Integration should not impact performance for non-scanning users

**Hardware Considerations:**
- USB HID scanners (keyboard emulation) - easiest integration
- Serial/RS232 scanners - require additional driver complexity
- Bluetooth scanners - connection management required
- Consider scanner configuration requirements (beep settings, format output)

**Related Documentation:**
- PRD: `docs/ways-of-work/plan/mtm-inventory-management/inventory-transaction-management/prd.md` (Phase 3)
- Manufacturing barcode standards and part numbering conventions
- Existing input handling patterns in InventoryTabView.axaml.cs
