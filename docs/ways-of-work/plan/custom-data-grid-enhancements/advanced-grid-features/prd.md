## 1. Feature Name

**Advanced CustomDataGrid Features: Column Management, Filtering, and Sorting**

## 2. Epic

- **Parent Epic**: Custom Data Grid Enhancement Epic

  - `Controls/CustomDataGrid/CustomDataGrid-UserStory-Spec-Implementation.md`
  - `Controls/CustomDataGrid/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS_REPORT.md`

## 3. Goal

### Problem

The current CustomDataGrid implementation provides basic data display and selection functionality but lacks advanced features that users expect from professional data grid components. Manufacturing users working with large inventory datasets need the ability to:

- Customize column visibility and ordering based on their workflow needs
- Filter data to focus on relevant inventory items without external controls
- Sort data by clicking column headers for quick data organization
- Manage column layouts and persist their preferred configurations

These missing capabilities force users to work with suboptimal views and rely on external filtering mechanisms, reducing productivity and user experience quality.

### Solution

Implement advanced data grid features in phases to provide enterprise-level functionality:

- **Phase 2**: Column sorting with visual indicators
- **Phase 3**: Column management panel with visibility toggles and reordering
- **Phase 4**: Interactive column resizing with drag handles
- **Phase 5**: Integrated filter panel with column-specific filtering

### Impact

- **Improved User Productivity**: 40% reduction in time spent navigating large datasets
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Professional-grade data grid matching industry standards
- **Reduced Training Time**: Intuitive interface reduces onboarding complexity
- **Better Data Management**: Users can focus on relevant data through filtering and sorting

## 4. User Personas

### Primary Persona: Inventory Management Specialist

- **Role**: Daily inventory operations and data analysis
- **Needs**: Quick access to specific inventory items, customizable views, efficient data sorting
- **Pain Points**: Large datasets are difficult to navigate, fixed column layouts don't match workflow

### Secondary Persona: Manufacturing Floor Supervisor

- **Role**: Monitoring inventory levels and production flow
- **Needs**: Real-time filtered views of critical inventory, quick sorting by priority fields
- **Pain Points**: Cannot focus on urgent items without external tools

### Tertiary Persona: System Administrator

- **Role**: Configuring system defaults and user preferences
- **Needs**: Ability to set default column layouts, manage filter presets
- **Pain Points**: No centralized way to configure data grid layouts for teams

## 5. User Stories

### Epic User Story

**As an inventory management specialist**, I want advanced data grid features (sorting, filtering, column management) so that I can efficiently navigate large datasets and customize the interface to match my workflow needs.

### Phase 2 - Column Sorting

- **As an inventory specialist**, I want to click column headers to sort data so that I can quickly organize inventory by any field (Part ID, Quantity, Date, etc.).
- **As a manufacturing supervisor**, I want visual sort indicators in headers so that I can see which column is currently sorted and in what direction.
- **As a data analyst**, I want to sort by multiple columns so that I can create complex data ordering (e.g., sort by Location, then by Part ID).

### Phase 3 - Column Management

- **As an inventory specialist**, I want to show/hide columns so that I can focus on data relevant to my current task.
- **As a manufacturing supervisor**, I want to reorder columns by dragging so that I can arrange the most important data first.
- **As a system administrator**, I want to save column configurations so that teams can share optimized layouts.

### Phase 4 - Column Resizing

- **As an inventory specialist**, I want to resize columns by dragging borders so that I can optimize space for different data types.
- **As a manufacturing supervisor**, I want column widths to persist so that my preferred sizing is remembered between sessions.
- **As a data analyst**, I want auto-fit column sizing so that columns automatically adjust to content width.

### Phase 5 - Integrated Filtering

- **As an inventory specialist**, I want to filter data within the grid so that I don't need external search controls.
- **As a manufacturing supervisor**, I want column-specific filters so that I can apply different criteria to each field.
- **As a system administrator**, I want to save filter presets so that common scenarios can be quickly applied.
