```text
I need you to refine and expand the MTM Custom Controls Discovery analysis with a focused approach for desktop/laptop Windows environments. Our manufacturing users exclusively use desktop workstations with keyboard/mouse or laptops with trackpads - NO tablet/touch optimization is needed.

REQUIREMENTS:

## Phase 1: Review and Refine Existing Discoveries

1. **Audit Current Custom Controls List**: 
   - Review the existing Top 10 Custom Controls from docs/recommendations/top-10-custom-controls.md
   - REMOVE any controls designed for touch/tablet (TouchOptimizedButton, touch-specific features)
   - REMOVE any Android-specific optimizations or references
   - Focus on desktop productivity and manufacturing efficiency

2. **Redesign Remaining Controls for Desktop Excellence**:
   - Optimize for keyboard shortcuts and mouse interactions
   - Implement proper focus management and tab navigation
   - Add desktop-specific features like context menus, drag-drop, keyboard accelerators
   - Ensure all controls work perfectly with Windows desktop themes and DPI scaling
   - Focus on manufacturing workstation efficiency (fast data entry, minimal mouse movement)

## Phase 2: Enhanced Desktop Custom Controls Discovery

Analyze the entire MTM WIP Application codebase (40+ Views, existing custom controls, ViewModels) and identify NEW desktop-optimized custom controls that would provide:

**Performance Benefits**:
- Faster rendering on desktop hardware
- Efficient memory usage for Windows workstations
- Optimized for desktop GPU acceleration
- Support for 10,000+ manufacturing records with smooth scrolling

**User Experience for Desktop Manufacturing**:
- Keyboard-first workflows with comprehensive shortcuts
- Mouse-optimized interactions (right-click menus, hover states)
- Desktop-native feel with Windows 11 design principles
- Multi-monitor support considerations
- Fast data entry patterns for manufacturing operators

**Quality Improvements**:
- Desktop-specific validation patterns
- Windows-native error handling and notifications
- Proper desktop accessibility (screen readers, high contrast)
- Integration with Windows clipboard and system features

## Phase 3: Identify Desktop-Specific Patterns

Look for these desktop manufacturing patterns across all 40+ Views:

1. **Keyboard-Heavy Data Entry**: Manufacturing operators prefer keyboard-centric workflows
2. **Right-Click Context Menus**: Desktop users expect context-sensitive options
3. **Drag and Drop Operations**: Natural for desktop inventory management
4. **Multi-Selection with Ctrl/Shift**: Standard desktop interaction patterns
5. **Window Management**: Proper support for resizing, minimizing, multi-monitor
6. **Copy/Paste Integration**: Seamless Windows clipboard integration
7. **Print Integration**: Manufacturing often requires desktop printing workflows

## Technical Requirements:

**Architecture Integration**:
- Avalonia UI 11.3.4 desktop-optimized patterns
- .NET 8 with Windows-specific optimizations where beneficial
- MVVM Community Toolkit with desktop event handling
- MTM theme system with Windows 11 design language
- Stored procedure integration for manufacturing workflows

**Desktop Performance Patterns**:
- Virtualization for large datasets on desktop hardware
- Efficient window rendering and updates
- Desktop-appropriate caching strategies
- Windows-native animations and transitions

**Manufacturing Workflow Optimization**:
- Fast part ID entry with keyboard shortcuts
- Efficient operation number selection (90, 100, 110, 120)
- Quick location navigation and selection
- Rapid quantity entry and validation
- Desktop-optimized error feedback and correction

## Expected Deliverables:

1. **Refined Top 10 Desktop Custom Controls**: Updated priority list removing touch/tablet controls and adding desktop-optimized alternatives

2. **New Desktop-Specific Custom Controls**: Discover 20 additional controls specifically designed for desktop manufacturing workstations

3. **Desktop UX Pattern Analysis**: Identify repetitive desktop UI patterns that could benefit from custom controls

4. **Keyboard Shortcut Integration Plan**: Comprehensive keyboard navigation strategy across all custom controls

5. **Desktop Performance Optimization Report**: Specific optimizations for Windows desktop hardware

6. **Windows Integration Opportunities**: Native Windows features that could enhance manufacturing workflows

## Analysis Scope:
- All 40+ AXAML Views with desktop interaction patterns
- Existing 3 custom controls optimized for desktop
- Manufacturing workflows optimized for keyboard/mouse
- Windows desktop integration opportunities
- Multi-monitor manufacturing workstation support
- Desktop printing and export workflows

Focus on creating the most efficient, keyboard-friendly, mouse-optimized manufacturing interface possible for Windows desktop environments while maintaining the performance, user experience, and quality goals from the original implementation plan.

Generate updated documentation that reflects this desktop-first approach and provides concrete implementation guidance for Windows desktop manufacturing workstations.
