@copilot Please continue work on the Advanced Theme Editor feature using the latest gap report:

PR #58 has made significant progress:
- Professional ColorPicker controls (RGB, HSL, Hex), sidebar navigation, palette generation buttons, and mandatory grid pattern are now present in ThemeEditorView.axaml.
- Real-time preview via ThemeService and partial accessibility features are implemented.
- Theme persistence, export/import, and versioning logic are in progress in ThemeEditorViewModel.cs.

Immediate next steps:
- Finalize ColorPicker controls for all color fields and sidebar navigation for all color categories.
- Validate and complete mandatory grid pattern and accessibility features (keyboard navigation, screen reader, high contrast).
- Complete theme persistence, export/import, versioning, rollback, and documentation features in ThemeEditorViewModel.cs.
- Implement advanced features: color history, eyedropper, color blindness simulation, print preview, lighting simulation, multi-monitor preview, theme templates, bulk color operations.
- Add/complete unit, integration, UI, and accessibility tests; perform thorough performance and accessibility validation.
