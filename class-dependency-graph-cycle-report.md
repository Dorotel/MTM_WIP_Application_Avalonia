# Dependency Cycle Analysis

## Summary

- **Total cycles detected**: 1
- **Average cycle complexity**: 2.0
- **Longest cycle**: 2 nodes

## Cycles (ordered by complexity)

### Cycle 1 (Complexity: 2)

`MTM_WIP_Application_Avalonia.OverlayResult → MTM_WIP_Application_Avalonia.OverlayResult → MTM_WIP_Application_Avalonia.OverlayResult`

## Hotspots

These components appear in multiple dependency cycles and might indicate design issues:

| Component | Appears in Cycles |
|-----------|------------------|
| MTM_WIP_Application_Avalonia.OverlayResult | 2 |

## Suggested Break Points

Modifying these components would break the most dependency cycles:

| Component | Impact (Cycles Broken) |
|-----------|------------------------|
| MTM_WIP_Application_Avalonia.OverlayResult | 1 |

## Recommendations

1. Consider refactoring components with high cycle involvement.
2. Look for opportunities to extract shared logic to break dependencies.
3. Consider applying design patterns like Mediator, Observer, or Facade to reduce direct dependencies.
4. Review the architecture to ensure it follows proper layering and dependency direction principles.
