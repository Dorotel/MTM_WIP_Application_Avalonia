/// Code-behind for RemoveLocationView - manages deletion of manufacturing location definitions.
/// Provides secure interface for removing location records from the MTM manufacturing system
/// with comprehensive safety validations to prevent disruption of active manufacturing operations
/// and maintain data integrity across inventory and workflow systems.
/// 
/// Location removal process includes:
/// - Safety validation against active inventory at the location
/// - Impact assessment on manufacturing workflows and operation routing
/// - Confirmation workflows with multiple approval stages
/// - Data migration assistance for dependent inventory records
/// - Comprehensive audit trail creation for regulatory compliance
/// 
/// Critical safety checks:
/// - Verification that no active inventory exists at the location
/// - Check for pending manufacturing operations at the location
/// - Assessment of workflow routing dependencies and impacts
/// - Validation of user authorization for location management operations
/// - Confirmation of backup and recovery procedures before deletion
/// 
/// Manufacturing impact considerations:
/// - Physical manufacturing area reorganization requirements
/// - Inventory relocation and transfer planning
/// - Manufacturing workflow and routing reconfiguration  
/// - Integration updates with external manufacturing execution systems
/// - Historical data preservation for audit trails and regulatory compliance
/// 
/// Follows minimal code-behind pattern with complex validation and removal logic handled by RemoveLocationViewModel.
