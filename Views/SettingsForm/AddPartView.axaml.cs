/// - Part ID assignment (unique identifier for manufacturing tracking)
/// - Part description and manufacturing specifications
/// - Classification and categorization for reporting
/// - Initial setup for inventory tracking parameters
/// - Integration with manufacturing operations and workflows
/// 
/// Data validation ensures:
/// - Unique part ID assignment across the manufacturing system
/// - Required manufacturing specifications are complete
/// - Proper integration with existing workflow operations
/// - Compliance with manufacturing data standards and conventions
/// 
/// Follows minimal code-behind pattern with validation and business logic handled by AddPartViewModel.
