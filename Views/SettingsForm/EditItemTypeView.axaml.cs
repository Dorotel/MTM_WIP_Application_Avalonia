/// Code-behind for EditItemTypeView - manages modification of manufacturing item type classifications.
/// Provides interface for updating item type definitions that categorize parts within the MTM manufacturing system.
/// Item types help organize manufacturing inventory and enable specialized reporting and workflow processing.
/// 
/// Item type modifications include:
/// - Type name and description updates
/// - Classification criteria and business rules
/// - Manufacturing workflow associations  
/// - Reporting category assignments
/// - Integration parameters with inventory systems
/// 
/// Business impact considerations:
/// - Changes affect existing inventory categorization and reporting
/// - Modifications may impact manufacturing workflow routing
/// - Updates require validation against active manufacturing operations
/// - Historical data integrity must be maintained during changes
/// 
/// Data integrity safeguards:
/// - Validation against active inventory using the item type
/// - Confirmation workflows for changes affecting production data  
/// - Audit trail maintenance for regulatory compliance
/// 
/// Follows minimal code-behind pattern with complex modification logic handled by EditItemTypeViewModel.
