/// Code-behind for RemoveUserView - manages deletion of user accounts from the manufacturing system.
/// Provides highly secure interface for removing user accounts from the MTM WIP Application
/// with comprehensive safety checks to maintain audit trails and ensure manufacturing operation continuity.
/// User removal is critical for security and regulatory compliance in manufacturing environments.
/// 
/// User removal process includes:
/// - Comprehensive safety validation against active manufacturing transactions
/// - Impact assessment on manufacturing audit trails and data ownership
/// - Multi-stage approval workflows with administrative authorization
/// - Data ownership transfer procedures for active manufacturing records
/// - Full audit trail preservation for regulatory compliance and historical tracking
/// 
/// Critical safety checks and validations:
/// - Verification of user transaction history and data ownership transfer
/// - Check for active manufacturing sessions and pending operations
/// - Assessment of audit trail impacts and regulatory compliance requirements
/// - Validation of administrative authorization for user management operations
/// - Confirmation of data backup and historical record preservation procedures
/// 
/// Manufacturing audit and compliance considerations:
/// - Transaction history preservation for manufacturing traceability
/// - Audit trail continuity for regulatory compliance (ISO, FDA, etc.)
/// - Data ownership transfer for manufacturing records and documentation
/// - Security access revocation and system cleanup procedures
/// - Historical manufacturing data attribution and accountability maintenance
/// 
/// Follows minimal code-behind pattern with complex user management logic handled by RemoveUserViewModel.
