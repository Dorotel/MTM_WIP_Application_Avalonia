/// Code-behind for EditOperationView - manages modification of manufacturing operation definitions.
/// Provides secure interface for updating operation parameters within the MTM manufacturing system.
/// Operations (such as "90" = Receiving, "100" = First Operation, "110" = Second Operation)
/// are fundamental to manufacturing workflow routing and require careful change management.
/// 
/// Operation modification capabilities include:
/// - Operation number and description updates (with extensive validation)
/// - Manufacturing workflow routing and sequence adjustments
/// - Quality control checkpoint and inspection procedure modifications
/// - Integration parameters with manufacturing execution systems
/// - Processing time estimates and capacity planning updates
/// 
/// Critical change management considerations:
/// - Impact assessment on active work-in-process inventory at the operation
/// - Validation against manufacturing workflow dependencies and routing logic
/// - Coordination with quality control systems and inspection procedures
/// - Integration updates with external manufacturing execution systems
/// - Historical data preservation for audit trails and regulatory compliance
/// 
/// Manufacturing workflow impact analysis:
/// - Part routing logic and workflow sequence validation
/// - Work-in-process inventory impact assessment and relocation planning
/// - Quality control checkpoint alignment and inspection procedure updates
/// - Manufacturing capacity and throughput impact evaluation
/// - System integration updates for external manufacturing systems
/// 
/// Follows minimal code-behind pattern with complex operation management logic handled by EditOperationViewModel.
