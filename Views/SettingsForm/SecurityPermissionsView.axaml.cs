/// Code-behind for SecurityPermissionsView - manages user access control and security settings.
/// Provides comprehensive interface for configuring user permissions, roles, and security policies
/// within the MTM WIP manufacturing application. Critical for maintaining data security and
/// ensuring proper access control in manufacturing operations.
/// 
/// Security management features:
/// - User role assignment and permission management
/// - Access control for manufacturing operations (inventory, transactions, master data)
/// - System administration privilege management  
/// - Audit trail configuration for regulatory compliance
/// - Security policy enforcement and validation
/// 
/// Permission levels typically include:
/// - Operator: Basic inventory transactions and viewing
/// - Supervisor: Transaction approval and basic reporting
/// - Administrator: Master data management and system configuration
/// - System Admin: Full system access and user management
/// 
/// Manufacturing security considerations:
/// - Separation of duties for critical manufacturing operations
/// - Audit requirements for regulatory compliance (ISO, FDA, etc.)
/// - Data privacy protection for manufacturing specifications
/// - Integration security with external manufacturing systems
/// 
/// Follows minimal code-behind pattern with complex security logic handled by SecurityPermissionsViewModel.
