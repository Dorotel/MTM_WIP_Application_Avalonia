/// <summary>
/// Code-behind for RemoveOperationView - manages deletion of manufacturing operation definitions.
/// Provides highly secure interface for removing operation records from the MTM manufacturing system.
/// Operations (like "90", "100", "110", "120") represent critical manufacturing workflow steps,
/// and their removal requires extensive safety validations to prevent manufacturing disruption.
/// 
/// Operation removal process includes:
/// - Comprehensive safety validation against active inventory at the operation
/// - Critical impact assessment on manufacturing workflows and part routing
/// - Multi-stage confirmation workflows with supervisor approval requirements
/// - Mandatory data migration planning for dependent inventory and transaction records
/// - Full audit trail creation for regulatory compliance and change management
/// 
/// Critical safety checks and validations:
/// - Verification that no work-in-process inventory exists at the operation
/// - Check for active manufacturing orders routing through the operation
/// - Assessment of workflow dependencies and downstream operation impacts
/// - Validation of user authorization and supervisor approval for operation changes
/// - Confirmation of comprehensive backup procedures before permanent deletion
/// 
/// Manufacturing workflow impact analysis:
/// - Part routing and workflow reconfiguration requirements
/// - Work-in-process inventory relocation and transfer planning
/// - Manufacturing execution system integration updates
/// - Quality control checkpoint and inspection procedure adjustments
/// - Historical manufacturing data preservation for regulatory audit trails
/// 
/// Follows minimal code-behind pattern with extensive validation logic handled by RemoveOperationViewModel.
