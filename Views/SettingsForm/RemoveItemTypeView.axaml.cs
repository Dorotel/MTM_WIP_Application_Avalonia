/// Code-behind for RemoveItemTypeView - manages deletion of manufacturing item type classifications.
/// Provides secure interface for removing item type definitions from the MTM manufacturing system
/// with comprehensive safety checks to prevent data integrity issues and manufacturing disruptions.
/// 
/// Item type removal process includes:
/// - Safety validation against active inventory using the item type
/// - Impact assessment on existing manufacturing operations and reporting
/// - Confirmation workflows to prevent accidental deletion
/// - Data migration options for dependent records
/// - Audit trail creation for regulatory compliance
/// 
/// Safety checks and validations:
/// - Verification that no active inventory exists with the item type
/// - Check for historical transaction dependencies 
/// - Assessment of reporting and analytics impacts
/// - Confirmation of user authorization for deletion operations
/// - Backup and recovery verification before permanent removal
/// 
/// Manufacturing impact considerations:
/// - Inventory classification and categorization effects
/// - Manufacturing workflow and routing implications
/// - Reporting system dependencies and data continuity
/// - Integration impacts with external manufacturing systems
/// - Historical data preservation for audit and compliance requirements
/// 
/// Follows minimal code-behind pattern with complex validation and removal logic handled by RemoveItemTypeViewModel.
