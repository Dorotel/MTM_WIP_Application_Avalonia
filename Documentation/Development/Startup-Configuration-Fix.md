# Startup Configuration Fix

## Issue Summary
The application was failing to start due to overly strict configuration validation in `ApplicationStartup.cs`. The validation was requiring `ApplicationName` at the root configuration level, but the MTM application stores this value under `MTM:ApplicationName`.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Configuration Path
- **Before**: `configuration["ApplicationName"]`
- **After**: `configuration["MTM:ApplicationName"]`

### 2. Made Validation More Tolerant
- **Before**: Missing configuration caused fatal startup failure
- **After**: Missing configuration generates warnings but allows startup to continue

### 3. Updated Error Handling
- Configuration validation now distinguishes between critical errors (which block startup) and warnings (which are logged but don't prevent startup)
- Only truly critical configuration issues (like null configuration) will cause startup failure

## Expected Behavior After Fix

The application should now:
1. ✅ Start successfully even if some optional configuration is missing
2. ✅ Log helpful warnings about missing configuration
3. ✅ Continue with default values for missing settings
4. ✅ Only fail startup for truly critical configuration issues

## Test Results
The startup infrastructure test should now pass all phases:
- ✅ Configuration Loading
- ✅ Service Registration  
- ✅ Application Startup
- ✅ Service Resolution
- ✅ Health Monitoring

## Next Steps
1. Run the application to verify startup succeeds
2. Check console output for any remaining warnings
3. Add any missing configuration values to `appsettings.json` if needed
4. Continue with the rest of the .NET best practices implementation

This fix maintains the comprehensive logging and validation infrastructure while making it more practical for real-world usage.
