### **User Interaction Flow**
1. **Advanced Filtering**: Apply complex filters to identify removal targets
2. **Bulk Removal Operations**: Perform batch removal with comprehensive validation
3. **History Management**: View detailed removal history with undo capabilities
4. **Analytics Generation**: Create removal reports and trend analysis
5. **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time feedback for bulk removal operations

## Business Logic Implementation

### **Morgan's Analysis - Database Operations and Business Rules**

#### **Core Database Operations**
```csharp
// Bulk Removal Operations
DaoResult<List<Model_HistoryRemove>> result = await Dao_Remove.BulkRemoveInventoryAsync(
    removalCriteria: bulkRemovalSpecs,
    removedBy: Model_AppVariables.User,
    progressCallback: _progressHelper?.UpdateProgress
);

// Removal History Tracking
List<Model_HistoryRemove> _lastRemovedItems = new List<Model_HistoryRemove>();

// Undo Operations
DaoResult<bool> undoResult = await Dao_Remove.UndoRemovalOperationAsync(
    removalTransactionId: selectedTransactionId,
    undoneBy: Model_AppVariables.User,
    undoReason: userProvidedReason
);

// Advanced Removal Analytics
DaoResult<DataTable> analyticsData = await Dao_Remove.GetRemovalAnalyticsAsync(
    dateRangeStart: filterStartDate,
    dateRangeEnd: filterEndDate,
    locationFilter: selectedLocation,
    userFilter: selectedUser
);
```

#### **Advanced Business Rules**
1. **Bulk Removal Validation**: Comprehensive validation before batch processing
2. **Undo Capability**: Ability to reverse removal operations with audit trail
3. **History Preservation**: Complete tracking of all removal activities
4. **Print Integration**: Professional printing capabilities for removal documentation
5. **Analytics Accuracy**: Ensure data consistency for removal reporting

#### **Safety and Audit Systems**
- **Removal Tracking**: Complete audit trail for all removal operations
- **Undo Mechanisms**: Comprehensive undo functionality with business rule validation
- **User Context**: Full user tracking for all removal and undo operations
- **Transaction Integrity**: Atomic operations with rollback capabilities
- **History Preservation**: Permanent retention of removal history for compliance

## Technical Implementation

### **Sam's Documentation - Technical Architecture**

#### **Initialization and History Management**
```csharp
public Control_AdvancedRemove()
{
    Service_DebugTracer.TraceMethodEntry(/* comprehensive debug tracking */);
    InitializeComponent();
    Core_Themes.ApplyThemeToControl(this);
    _lastRemovedItems = new List<Model_HistoryRemove>();
    SetupAdvancedRemovalFeatures();
}

public void SetProgressControls(ToolStripProgressBar progressBar, ToolStripStatusLabel statusLabel)
{
    _progressHelper = Helper_StoredProcedureProgress.Create(progressBar, statusLabel, 
        this.FindForm() ?? throw new InvalidOperationException("Control must be added to a form"));
}
```

#### **Undo System Architecture**
The control implements a comprehensive undo system for removal operations:

1. **Transaction Tracking**: Each removal operation tracked as discrete transaction
2. **Undo Validation**: Business rule validation before allowing undo operations
3. **State Restoration**: Complete restoration of inventory state including audit trails
4. **User Authorization**: Verification of user permissions for undo operations
5. **Audit Logging**: Complete logging of both removal and undo activities

#### **Printing Integration**
```csharp
// Professional printing capabilities
using System.Drawing.Printing;

private void PrintRemovalSummary()
{
    PrintDocument printDoc = new PrintDocument();
    printDoc.PrintPage += PrintRemovalSummaryPage;
    // Configure print settings and execute
}
```

#### **Bulk Operations Framework**
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient bulk removal operations with progress tracking
- **Conditional Logic**: Advanced conditional removal based on multiple criteria
- **Memory Optimization**: Efficient handling of large removal datasets
- **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive error handling and partial operation recovery

### **Performance Characteristics**
- **Async Operations**: Non-blocking UI during bulk removal operations
- **Memory Management**: Efficient handling of large removal history datasets
- **Progress Feedback**: Real-time status updates for user confidence
- **Resource Cleanup**: Proper disposal of printing resources and database connections

## History and Undo Management

### **Advanced History System**
The control maintains comprehensive removal history:

```csharp
private readonly List<Model_HistoryRemove> _lastRemovedItems = [];

// History tracking for undo capabilities
private void TrackRemovalOperation(Model_HistoryRemove removalRecord)
{
    _lastRemovedItems.Add(removalRecord);
    // Maintain history for undo operations
}
```

### **Undo Capabilities**
- **Transaction-based Undo**: Undo entire removal transactions atomically
- **Selective Undo**: Undo specific items from bulk removal operations
- **Business Rule Validation**: Ensure undo operations maintain data integrity
- **Audit Trail Preservation**: Complete logging of undo activities
