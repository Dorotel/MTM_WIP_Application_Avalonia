Based on the comprehensive analysis of the MTM WIP Application documentation system and the need for 100% accuracy verification, here are the specific steps that should be taken to ensure instruction file accuracy during the consolidation process:

---

# **🔍 Instruction File Accuracy Verification Protocol**

## **Phase 1: Pre-Consolidation Discovery & Assessment**

### **Step 1.1: Complete File Discovery**
```
Act as Quality Assurance Auditor Copilot following MTM WIP Application guidelines. Execute comprehensive repository scan to locate ALL files with "-instruction.md" or "-instructions.md" suffixes throughout the MTM_WIP_Application_Avalonia repository:

1. Search in ALL directories including:
   - .github/ and subdirectories
   - Development/ and all subdirectories
   - Documentation/ and all subdirectories
   - Root directory and any scattered locations
   - Any hidden or nested folders

2. For each discovered file, catalog:
   - Full file path and current location
   - File size and last modified date
   - Content summary (first 500 characters)
   - Primary functional category (UI, Database, Quality, etc.)
   - Cross-reference dependencies identified

3. Create master inventory spreadsheet with discovery results
4. Identify any duplicate filenames or conflicting content
5. Flag any files that appear to be outdated or incomplete

Generate complete discovery report with prioritized consolidation recommendations.
```

### **Step 1.2: Current Codebase State Analysis**
```
Act as Quality Assurance Auditor Copilot. Analyze current MTM WIP Application Avalonia codebase to establish accuracy baseline:

1. Inventory current implementation status:
   - .NET 8 target framework verification
   - Avalonia UI version and package dependencies
   - ReactiveUI implementation patterns in use
   - Service layer architecture (AddMTMServices usage)
   - Database access patterns (stored procedure usage)
   - MTM business logic implementation

2. Document current architectural decisions:
   - Dependency injection configuration
   - Navigation service implementation
   - Theme system and color palette usage
   - Error handling patterns
   - Data model structures

3. Identify recent changes or additions:
   - New services or ViewModels added
   - Database schema updates
   - UI pattern changes
   - Business logic modifications

Create comprehensive codebase state report for instruction file accuracy comparison.
```

## **Phase 2: Content Accuracy Verification**

### **Step 2.1: Code Example Verification**
```
Act as Quality Assurance Auditor Copilot. For each instruction file, perform detailed code example accuracy verification:

1. Extract ALL code examples from instruction files
2. For each code example, verify:
   - Syntax correctness for .NET 8 and Avalonia
   - ReactiveUI pattern accuracy (RaiseAndSetIfChanged, ReactiveCommand, etc.)
   - MTM business logic compliance (TransactionType determination, Operation handling)
   - Database access pattern compliance (stored procedures only)
   - Service registration patterns match AddMTMServices implementation
   - Color scheme values match current MTM palette

3. Cross-check examples against actual implementation:
   - Compare with current service interfaces
   - Verify against actual ViewModel implementations
   - Check database procedure patterns
   - Validate UI generation patterns

4. Document discrepancies with specific corrections needed:
   - Outdated syntax or patterns
   - Missing new patterns or features
   - Incorrect business logic examples
   - Deprecated or removed functionality

Generate code example accuracy report with line-by-line corrections.
```

### **Step 2.2: Architecture Pattern Verification**
```
Act as Quality Assurance Auditor Copilot. Verify all architectural patterns described in instruction files:

1. Dependency Injection Patterns:
   - Verify AddMTMServices extension method documentation

   - Confirm interface and implementation mappings

2. MVVM and ReactiveUI Patterns:
   - Verify ViewModel base class patterns
   - Check observable property implementations
   - Validate command creation patterns
   - Confirm error handling approaches

3. Database Access Patterns:
   - Verify stored procedure call patterns
   - Check parameter passing examples

```

### **Step 2.3: MTM Business Logic Verification**
```
Act as Quality Assurance Auditor Copilot. Verify MTM-specific business logic accuracy:

1. Transaction Type Logic:
   - Verify TransactionType determination rules (USER INTENT vs Operation)
   - Check Operation number handling (string numbers, workflow steps)
   - Validate business logic examples

2. Data Pattern Accuracy:
   - Verify Part ID format specifications (string format)
   - Check quantity handling patterns (integer)
   - Validate location and user tracking

3. MTM Color Scheme:
   - Verify all color codes match current palette
   - Check resource mapping examples
   - Validate gradient and styling patterns

4. Workflow Integration:
   - Verify manufacturing step documentation
   - Check inventory management patterns
   - Validate user role and permission handling

Generate MTM business logic accuracy report with specific corrections.
```

## **Phase 3: Cross-Reference and Dependency Verification**

### **Step 3.1: Internal Link Validation**
```
Act as Quality Assurance Auditor Copilot. Audit all internal cross-references between instruction files:

1. Extract all cross-references from instruction files:
   - Direct file references (see filename.instruction.md)
   - Section references within files
   - Related file mentions
   - See also references

2. Validate each cross-reference:
   - Target file exists at referenced location
   - Referenced section exists in target file
   - Link context is still relevant
   - No circular or broken references

3. Map reference dependencies:
   - Create dependency graph of instruction file relationships
   - Identify missing connections
   - Document orphaned references
   - Plan consolidation impact on references

Generate cross-reference validation report with link repair recommendations.
```

### **Step 3.2: Completeness Gap Analysis**
```
Act as Quality Assurance Auditor Copilot. Identify missing documentation coverage:

1. Compare codebase against instruction file coverage:
