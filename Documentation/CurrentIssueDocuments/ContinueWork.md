     * --accent-gold: #FFD700 (Gold trim and highlights)
     * --mtm-purple: #4B45ED, --mtm-magenta: #BA45ED
   - Complete readability issue resolution (crisp, non-blurry text)
   - Finish accessibility compliance (WCAG AA standards)

3. MIGRATION CONTINUATION:
   - Complete file migration from Documentation/ to docs/ folder
   - Finish internal link updates and asset reference corrections
   - Complete directory structure: Technical/, PlainEnglish/, Components/, assets/
   - Finish content synchronization with source instruction files

CRITICAL: Maintain navigation functionality during migration.
```

### **IF PHASE 4 INCOMPLETE - Resume Automated Framework**
```
Continue Phase 4 from current state:

1. VERIFICATION FRAMEWORK CONTINUATION:
   - Complete PowerShell cross-reference validation script implementation
   - Finish C# framework compliance checker
   - Complete MTM pattern validator with JSON rules
   - Finish automated code example validation

2. HTML AUTOMATION CONTINUATION:
   - Complete Node.js HTML-to-source synchronization checker
   - Finish SCSS CSS compliance checker
   - Complete Python accessibility compliance checker
   - Finish PowerShell file migration validator

3. QUALITY GATES CONTINUATION:
   - Complete implementation: Critical Gate (0 issues), High Priority Gate (≤2 issues)
   - Finish Overall Accuracy Gate (≥85% score) implementation
   - Complete Cross-Reference Gate (100% functional links)

CRITICAL: Ensure all automation scripts are functional and tested.
