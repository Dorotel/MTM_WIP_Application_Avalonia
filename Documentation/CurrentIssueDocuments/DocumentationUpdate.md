2. **Group instruction files** into logical folders within `.github/` based on functional intent
3. **Maintain copilot-instructions.md** as the master instruction file in `.github/` root
4. **Verify 100% content accuracy** and completeness of all instruction files
5. **Ensure no missing information** or broken cross-references between files
6. **Establish hierarchical reading system** where copilot-instructions.md references appropriate child files

### **🔍 Instruction File Discovery & Inventory**

**Primary Prompt for File Discovery:**
```
Act as Quality Assurance Auditor Copilot. Conduct comprehensive repository scan to locate ALL files with "-instruction.md" or "-instructions.md" suffixes throughout the MTM_WIP_Application_Avalonia repository.
